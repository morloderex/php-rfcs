====== PHP RFC: Throw Error in Extensions ======
  * Version: 0.1

===== Introduction =====
With PHP 7, most fatal and recoverable errors in the engine where changed to instead throw an instance of ''Error''. However this change was only made in the engine. Extensions still use fatal and recoverable errors instead of throwing exceptions.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes changing most conditions raising an ''E_ERROR'' or ''E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR'' errors to throw an instance of ''Error'' instead. Conditions due to memory errors or other unrecoverable errors will still remain fatal errors.

Please see [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1942|PR #1942]] for a complete diff of all the conditions changed to throw an ''Error''.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Generally none, though it is possible some exceptions thrown could be unintentionally caught by code written for PHP 7. However, it is rare for ''Error'' exceptions to be caught outside of cleanup or logging, so catching these exceptions is likely desirable over a fatal error.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.1

===== Voting =====
A majority of 50%+1 is required to approve this RFC.
