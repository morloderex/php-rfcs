====== PHP RFC: Isset/Set Operator ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-11-24
  * Author: Chris London, me chrislondon co
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

Two new operators. ?= for setting the value of an unset or falsey variable. And ??: which acts like ?: except it it also checks is set.

===== Proposal =====

?= Will be a new operator that allows the user to set an unset or falsey variable. This handy operator will help avoid dreaded unset variable notices.




To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
