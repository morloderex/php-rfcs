====== PHP RFC: Isset/Set Operator ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-11-24
  * Author: Chris London, me chrislondon co
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

Two new operators. ?= for setting the value of an unset or falsey variable. And ??: which acts like ?: except it it also checks is set.

===== Proposal =====

?= Will be a new operator that allows the user to set an unset or falsey variable. This handy operator will help avoid dreaded unset variable notices.

    $foo ?= 'default';
    
    // which is functionally equivalent to:
    $foo = (isset($foo) && $foo) ? $foo : 'default';
    
    // or
    if (!isset($foo) || !$foo) $foo = 'default';
