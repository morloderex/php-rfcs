====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 7.3 ======
  * Date: 2017-08-02
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

This is a draft RFC for multiple deprecations targeting PHP 7.3. The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 7.3 and remove it no later than in PHP 8.0.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * TODO

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately. Each vote requires a 2/3 majority, independently of whether it is a language or standard library change. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 7.3 and removal in the next major version (presumably PHP 8.0).

==== Entry ====

Description

Proposed action: TODO

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 7.3 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 8.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Each of the bullet points above will get a separate vote. All votes will require a 2/3 supermajority, independently of whether they are language changes or not.

===== Patches and Tests =====

The patches for these deprecations are for the most part trivial, as such they will be provided once the RFC is accepted (or portions of it).
