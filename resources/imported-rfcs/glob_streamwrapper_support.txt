====== PHP RFC: StreamWrapper Support for glob() ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2022-08-15
  * Author: Timmy Almroth, timmy.almroth@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft (or Under Discussion or Accepted or Declined)
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/glob_streamwrapper_support

===== Introduction =====
The current implementation of glob() is a thin wrapper for POSIX glob(3). It is missing support for StreamWrappers. Workarounds are hard. Some projects may rely on regular expressions which are totally different from globbing. Some may attempt the use of fnmatch() which does not support bracket expansions.

===== Proposal =====
Implement StreammWrapper support for glob(). Example: <code>glob('vfs://*.ext')</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No backwards incompatibility

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
No noted impacts as glob() will continue working as before, apart from the new StreamWrapper support. Draft performance testing shows no anomalies for performance.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Local file system operations e.g. glob('*.ext') would not be affected by this change.

===== Future Scope =====
There has been some discussion about the future of PHP glob() and the maintained win32 implementation. Whether it could be replaced by a standalone implementation rather than a layer of POSIX. 

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Should we implement StreamWrapper support for PHP glob()?

===== Patches and Tests =====
Patches and tests can be found in the Feature Request [[https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/9224|#9224]].
Final path will be produced by Github user @KapitanOczywisty.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
