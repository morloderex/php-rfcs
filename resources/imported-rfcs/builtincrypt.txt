====== Request for Comments: Prefer PHP's Builtin Crypt over System versions ======
  * Version: 1.0

===== Purpose =====

In order to provide a consistent implementation of all crypt() algorithms for all users of PHP, it is proposed that in an upcoming release of PHP, we always use the PHP-provided versions of all supported algorithms.

==== Pros ====

  - It will simplify the m4 files for the crypt() extension.
  - It will provide consistent behaviour for all users of PHP.
  - It is internally consistent with other, similar decisions such as bundling our own timezone database and versions of various hashing algorithms.
  - The crypt() documentation has recently been dramatically improved, but only documents the built-in algorithms. An effort to maintain a list of possible system-level incompatibilities would probably be prohibitive.
  - Prevent the filing of bugs when different systems use different crypt()

==== Cons ====
  - Some systems vendors have previously shown resistance to PHP preferring its bundled versions of facilities the OS provides
  - ???

===== Changelog =====
