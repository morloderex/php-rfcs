===== Introduction =====

Since PHP 7 now have return types in user-land, but internal functions didn't support it.
This RFC propose support internal function return types to make it consist.

===== Proposal =====

Support declare internal function/method return types, this could help make internal functions
API testable, this could also makes extension-implemented frameworks/libraries control their
return types.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No BC break;

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No

==== To Opcache ====
No

==== New Constants ====

New Macro to support declare return types of functions/methods:

- ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_INFO()
- ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_INFO_EX() 

==== php.ini Defaults ====
None

===== Open Issues =====

1. Should we raise E_CORE_ERROR when error detected, should we just ignore it with a warning?
2. Return Types RFC internally support Nullable Types, but user land not, this RFC also support that,
   Should support it?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
User-land return types not affected

===== Future Scope =====
None
