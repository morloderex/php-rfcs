===== Introduction =====

Current it is possible to optionally specify a prefix to generated filenames. In some cases however it is needed to create files with a certain suffix (like a file-extension) because other tools rely on for example a graphic-name ending with .png.

===== Proposal =====

Add new, optional parameter $suffix to tempnam().

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Internal API-changes since the additional parameter is added.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

5.6

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

all

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

none

===== Patches and Tests =====
