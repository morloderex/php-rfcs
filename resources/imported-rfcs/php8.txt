====== Proposals for PHP 8 ======

===== Introduction =====
This page is a spot to list and discuss ideas for PHP 8. This is not a place to discuss features which may be accepted in the 7.X series; it is for features which require backwards compatibility breaks to achieve.

===== Ideas and Proposals =====
  * Unify behavior of userland and internal functions.
    * In particular when internal functions fail to parse argument types correctly they fail by returning null. Userland functions throw a TypeError.
  * **[[rfc:php8:merge_member_symbol_tables|Merge Member Symbol Tables]]**. This draft RFC focuses on the benefits and drawbacks to merging the class constant, property and symbol tables.
