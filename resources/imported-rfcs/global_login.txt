  * Status: Draft 
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/global_login 
  * Possible developer: Aaron Junker, [[mailto:aaronjunker@php.net|aaronjunker@php.net]]

===== Introduction =====
Currently there are diffrent login systems all over php.net:

  * wiki.php.net uses wiki intern login or login over VCS account
  * pecl.php.net uses an own login system
  * bugs.php.net uses own login system or login over VCS account
  * Mailing lists are using own tracking system
  * edit.php.net allows login over several platforms (also GitHub),VCS and anonym login
  * php.net user contribution notes uses no login
  * php.net preferences use cookies to save preferences.
  * GitHub php source code uses GitHub login

Currently there is a login system called VCS ac count which generate a @php.net mail, but you need to request it and the normal user is not able to get one.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes different scenarios for creating a global php.net login experience.

==== 1.1 Global login system ====

Add a global system all over php.net that allows you to login with one account over all pages. This will add a login and register button to the general PHP design.

main.php.net will be restructured to be used by general users and not just VCS account users.

==== 1.2 Type of global login system ====

There are 3 proposed cases of how we could create a global login system:

=== Use oAuth from GitHub ===

Use GitHub to log into php.net. GitHub is used for development of PHP and so on every developer of PHP has one. 

=== Use own system ===

Advantages: Full control over users and their data.

Disadvantages: Resources needed to create such a system, that we currently don't have.

==== 1.3 VCS accounts ====

You will be able to connect your existing VCS account to the new php.net account and use the same features as before. VCS registration will   

==== 2.1 www.php.net user preferences ====

==== 2.2 www.php.net user contribution notes ====

==== 3.1 bugs.php.net login ====

==== 4.1 edit.php.net login ====

==== 5.1 pecl.php.net and pear.php.net login ====

==== 6.1 people.php.net ====

==== 7.1 wiki.php.net ====

wiki.php.net runs on Dokuwiki, a software that can be extended by plugins. The idea here is to create an own plugin that redirects from and to the PHP account service.

main.php.net will provide a feature to transfer the rights you had with your old wiki account to your new php.net account.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

==== 1.1 Global login system ====

Do you want a global login system on php.net? 

If you vote "no" please vote on the other votings like the result would be "yes", because when this vosting results in "no" all other votings in this RFC get nulled.
