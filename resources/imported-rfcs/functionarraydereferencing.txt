===== Introduction =====

This RFC is incomplete and [currently] exists as a historical record for the discussion of this feature request.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

No proposal, or patch, as this is simply information gathering for archival purposes.

===== Examples =====
FAD adds the following:

<code php>
<?php

echo fruit()['a']; // apple

function fruit () {
  return array('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana');
}
?>
</code>

Which is a quasi-replacement for this:

<code php>
<?php

$fruits = fruit();
echo $fruits['a'];

function fruit () {
  return array('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana');
}
?>
</code>
