===== Introduction =====

Note: This RFC was given the "declined" status because it was never implemented or strongly desired. However, no official discussion exists to "decline" except CVS does not lie, and it's not in CVS.

This RFC is incomplete and exists as a historical record for the discussion of this feature request.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

No proposal, or patch, as this is simply information gathering for archival purposes.

===== Examples =====
FAD adds the following:

<code php>
<?php

echo fruit()['a']; // apple

function fruit () {
  return array('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana');
}
?>
</code>

Which is a quasi-replacement for this:

<code php>
<?php

$fruits = fruit();
echo $fruits['a'];

function fruit () {
  return array('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana');
}
?>
</code>
