===== Introduction =====
PHP 7 introduced scalar types for parameters and also for declaring return types for functions.

However it is not currently possible to declare that a function either needs to be passed an object as a parameter, or to declare that a function must return an object.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes that ''object'' should be used as a parameter type and as a return type. Any object would pass the type check.

Passing a value that is not an object to a parameter that is declared as type ''object'' would fail the type check, and a TypeError would be thrown.

Similarly, if a function is declared as returning an ''object'' but does not return an object, again a TypeError would be thrown.

As it would be used internally, object would become a reserved classname, unavailable for use as a class name in userland code.

For class methods that use object as either a parameter or return type, the same inheritance rules would apply for inherited methods as all other parameter/return types i.e. invariant.

===== Examples =====

==== Parameter type ====

<code php>
function acceptsObject(object $obj) {
    ...
}

// This code can be statically analyzed to be correct
acceptsObject(json_decode('{}'));

// This code can be statically analyzed to be correct
acceptsObject(new \MyObject());

// This can be statically analysed to contain an error.
// and would throw an TypeError at runtime.
acceptsObject("Ceci n'est pas une object.");
</code>

==== Return type ====
Functions and methods can be declared with an object return type, to enforce that the function must return an object.

<code php>
// This function can be statically analysed to conform to the
// return type
function correctFunction() : object {
    $obj = json_decode('{}');

    return $obj;
}

// This function can be statically analysed to contain an error
// and will also fail at runtime.
function errorFunction() : object {
    return [];
}
</code>

===== Benefits =====

==== Make code easier to understand ====

Although most code deals with specific types, there are several types of library where it is common to handle arbitrary object types. 

=== Hydrators + data extractor ===

Hydrators allow objects to be filled with data from an array. Extractors do the opposite, they take an object and return an array of data.

<code php>
interface Hydration {
  // Hydrate an object by populating data
  public function hydrate(array $data, object $object) : object;
}

interface Extraction {
  // Extract values from an object
  public function extract(object $object) : array;
}
</code>

The extraction step can take an arbitrary object as the sole parameter. The hydration step can take an arbitrary object as the second parameter, and will return an arbitrary object. Having the type for the parameters and the return type be set as ''object'' will make the expected types be clearer to anyone using these functions, as well as detect incorrect types if there is an error in the code.

=== Service containers and DIC libraries ===

For both service containers and dependency injection libraries, it is common to want to put services and other objects into the container. 

<code php>
interface ServiceContainer {
  // Set service definition
  public function set(string $id, object $service);

  // Retrieve service object from container
  public function get(string $id) : object;
}
</code>

Additionally, ORM libraries such as Doctrine have functions that will either consume or produce arbitrary objects.


==== Catching return errors ====

Having an object return type would allow some errors to be detected more quickly. The following function is meant to return an object. With the object return typ set for the function, failing to return an object would cause a TypeError to be thrown in the location where the bug is.

<code php>
function unserialize($data) : object {

    $type = $data['type'];
    
    switch ($type) {
        case 'foo': { return new Foo(); }
        case 'bar': { return new Ba(); }
        case 'zot': { new zot(); }  // Ooops, this is an error
    }
}
</code>

Without the object return type, an incorrect value of null is returned from the function. This error can only be found by debugging at runtime.

==== Enforcing signature in inheritance ====

Currently, as PHP does not allow 'object' to be used as a return type, it is not possible to enforce the return type in a child class. In this example the method is supposed to return an object, but a programmer has changed what the function does in the child class.

<code php>
class WidgetFactory {
    function create() {
        return new Widget();
    }
}

class CustomWidgetFactory extends WidgetFactory {
    function create() {
        $object = new Widget();

        return true; //This is an error that cannot be statically analyzed.
    }
}

</code>

This type of error can only be detected when running the code.

If we had object as a type, even if a programmer misunderstood what the method was supposed to do, and accidentally tried to create a child class that had a different signature, the code would not compile, and the error would be caught before the code is run:

<code php>
class WidgetFactory {
    function create() : object {
        return new Widget();
    }
}

class CustomWidgetFactory extends WidgetFactory {
    // This class would not compile, as the signature of the metod in
    // the child class is not compatible with the method signature in 
    // the parent class.
    function create() : bool {
       ...
    }
}
</code>


If the programmer wrote the correct signature for the method in the child class, but returned the wrong value, this error would also be caught:

<code php>
class WidgetFactory {
    function create() : object {
        return new Widget();
    }
}

class CustomWidgetFactory extends WidgetFactory {
    function create() : object {
        $object = new Widget();

        // returning something that is not an object throws a TypeError exception.
        return true;
    }
}
</code>

This would also be an error detectable by a static analyzer.

===== Reflection =====
There are two changes in reflection:

  * ReflectionType::isBuiltin returns true for parameters and return types declared as 'object'.

  * ReflectionType::__toString returns “object” for parameters and return types declared as 'object'.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Althought object is soft reserved word this RFC adds object as reserved classname. This may collide with existing classes which are neither namespaced nor prefixed.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.2.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None.

==== Unaffected PHP Functionality ====
This doesn't affect the behaviour of cast operators.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. The vote is a straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC and merging the patch.
