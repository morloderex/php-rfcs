===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.4 and removal in PHP 9.

==== Soft-deprecated DOMDocument and DOMEntity properties ====

Author: Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>

The following properties have already been soft-deprecated for a long time:
  * ''DOMDocument::$actualEncoding'': it is just an alias to ''DOMDocument::$encoding''
  * ''DOMDocument::$config'': it has always returned null
  * ''DOMEntity::$actualEncoding'': it has always returned null
  * ''DOMEntity::$encoding'': it has always returned null
  * ''DOMEntity::$version'': it has always returned null

==== DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version) ====

Author: Niels Dossche <nielsdos@php.net>

<php>DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)</php> used to be a feature of DOM Core Level 3 https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/DOM3-Core.html#core-DOMImplementation3-getFeature, but it was never implemented in PHP, i.e. it always threw a "not implemented" exception. It was also never documented because of this. Furthermore, the feature has been removed from the current living DOM spec. It doesn't make sense to keep a feature alive that has never been implemented and is removed by the reference specification.

==== Constant DOM_PHP_ERR ====

Author: Niels Dossche <nielsdos@php.net>

PR https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11927 got rid of the last use of DOM_PHP_ERR in PHP.
It is a non-standard and non-well-defined error code. The last use was for an out-of-memory situation but that's inconsistent as we normally use INVALID_STATE_ERR for that.

GitHub search reveals [[https://github.com/search?q=DOM_PHP_ERR+language%3APHP&type=code&l=PHP|174 matches]] (as of Jan 20 2024) for DOM_PHP_ERR. There are occurrences in string-form, i.e. <php>"DOM_PHP_ERR"</php> that normally doesn't get affected, some in code quality/compatibility tools, and some in php-src fork's stub files.

The remaining actual use is in Symfony's DOMCaster in an array that maps a constant back to its actual name. They can fix the deprecation by replacing the constant with its value until versions older than PHP 8.4 no longer need to be supported by the library.
There don't seem to be any other actual users of this.

==== mysqli_ping() and mysqli::ping() ====

The purpose of <php>mysqli_ping()</php> and <php>$mysqli->ping()</php> is to check whether the connection is live and attempt reconnection if it is not. This only works if mysqli is compiled with libmysql. The support for this has been removed in PHP 8.2. 
As it's no longer possible to use automatic reconnection in PHP 8.2, the <php>mysqli_ping()</php> function has become useless. 

For users who simply want to check if the connection is alive, they can use <php>DO 1</php> or similar SQL query to see if it succeeds. There is no need to offer such functionality in PHP anymore.

==== unserialize()'s 'S' tag ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

Strings serialized with PHP's native serialization mechanism are represented with the (lowercase) ''s'' tag, followed by the length of the string and the raw binary representation of the string contents. During the development of the never-released PHP 6, the serialization format of binary strings [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/1f2d5e3b00d19bd6d0db40d7fc2badaa2d65082e|was changed]] to use an escaped representation for non-ASCII characters, likely to make the serialization output compatible with PHP 6's Unicode strings where not all byte sequences are valid. This escaped format was then represented with the uppercase ''S'' tag [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/7ccba6624df074051f24efabd5d88d9c0d2a8ec0|in a follow-up commit]] and support for that uppercase ''S'' tag [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/8f5310afad0eeef6f2e45a03f6ff7d4a2a7653ce|added to PHP 5]] in an attempt to provide interoperability with serialized binary strings between PHP 5 and PHP 6. This support for the uppercase ''S'' tag remains in PHP until today.

PHP's native serializer is a security-sensitive part of the standard library, the simpler the logic the smaller the chance for security issues and the easier it is to verify the code for correctness. There are no tests verifying the functionality of the uppercase ''S'' tag and no released version emitted the uppercase ''S'' tag, thus deprecating and ultimately removing the support for the ''S'' tag is exceedingly unlikely to affect anyone.

Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12309

==== session.sid_length and session.sid_bits_per_character ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

PHP’s session extension currently contains two INI settings that allow the administrator to respectively control the length and the possible characters within emitted session IDs.

  * The length may be configured as any value between 22 and 256.
  * The bits per character may be selected to be either 4 (''[0-9a-f]''), 5 (''[0-9a-v]''), or 6 (''[0-9a-zA-Z,-]''), returning the characters indicated by the regular expression character group within the parentheses.

In [[https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/12418|issue #12418]] it was reported that configuring 6 bits per character might generate session IDs that are rejected by WAF applications, such as mod_security. The 6 bits per character configuration might generate session IDs containing dashes, more specifically two consecutive dashes. Within an SQL query two consecutive dashes indicate the start of a comment, which is a common technique when exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, leading to a false positive within the WAF and rejecting any requests containing such a session ID.

The default is a 32 character SID, with 4 bits of entropy per character, resulting in a 128-bit session ID. 128 bits of entropy [[https://security.stackexchange.com/a/102163/21705|is generally considered the correct choice for a secret value]]. More is unnecessary and less raises eyebrows. Guessing a 128 Bit value with a probability of 10^-11 would require roughly 2^46 guesses. At 100_000 guesses per second it would take 23 years to even reach this negligible probability.

In other words changing the default values will either generate session IDs that raise eyebrows (4 bits per character with less than 32 characters or 5 bpc for less than 26 characters) or generate session IDs that are needlessly strong, increasing CPU costs, due to the additional randomness required, and increasing the chance for interoperability problems, such as the mod_security example.

For this reason we propose to deprecate the two INI settings in favor of the opinionated choice of the current defaults of a 32 character hexadecimal session ID.

The hexadecimal character set is not expected to cause any interoperability issues, as it is the most limited one of the currently available ones and hexadecimal identifiers are likely the most commonly used. While this would increase the length of the session ID from the previous minimum of 22 characters (which is a secure choice when combined with 6 bits per character) to 32, we do not expect this to be an issue in practice. The difference in traffic is minimal and a hexadecimal session ID is trivially packed into a 16 Byte binary string using <php>hex2bin()</php>, should storage requirements of the session backend be a concern.

==== Constant SID ====

Author: Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>

Constant <php>SID</php> is created when a session is initialized, containing the current session ID. Unlike other constants value, it changes to the new ID when ''php_session_reset_id()'' is called. This behavior contradicts to any other well behaved constants, therefore it's deprecated.

==== Deprecate SplFixedArray::__wakeup() ====

TODO: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/9704

==== xml_set_object() and xml_set_*_handler() with string method names ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The XML extension allows registering callbacks that are invoked when encountering certain XML triggers, such as the start of a new element or a processing instruction, via the relevant <php>xml_set_*_handler()</php> function.

However, these functions also allow setting a method name, as a string, that should be called on the object provided via <php>xml_set_object()</php>. This behaviour is very strange and seems to date prior to the introduction of proper callables for object methods via the <php>[$objInstance, 'methodName']</php> syntax.

The proposal is to deprecate the <php>xml_set_object()</php> function and passing non-callable strings to the <php>xml_set_*_handler()</php> functions. This would also mean to unset a handler the value of <php>null</php> must be used instead of an empty string witch is also currently allowed.

==== Deprecate passing null and false to dba_key_split() ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The signature of <php>dba_key_split()</php> is currently <php>function dba_key_split(string|false|null $key): array|false {}</php>.

However, passing <php>null</php> or <php>false</php> to this function will make it immediately return <php>false</php>,
this is the case since at least PHP 5.3, probably earlier.

Moreover, since PHP 8.0, this is the only way for this function to return <php>false</php>.

The proposal is to deprecate passing <php>null</php> and <php>false</php> to the <php>$key</php> parameter, which will allow to clean up the return type of this function in the next major version to just <php>array</php>.

==== Non-numeric seed strings in XXHash family ====

TODO: https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/10305


==== Constants SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING, SUNFUNCS_RET_DOUBLE, SUNFUNCS_RET_TIMESTAMP ====

Author: Jorg Sowa <jorg.sowa@gmail.com>

The functions <php>date_sunrise()</php>/<php>date_sunset()</php> are [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_1|already deprecated since PHP 8.1]] and will be removed in the next major version.

The proposal is to deprecate constants SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING, SUNFUNCS_RET_DOUBLE, SUNFUNCS_RET_TIMESTAMP which are used exclusively with those functions.

==== Remove E_STRICT error level and deprecate E_STRICT constant ====

Author of implementation: Michael Voříšek (mvorisek)

RFC author: Jorg Sowa <jorg.sowa@gmail.com>, Michael Voříšek (mvorisek)

Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/13053

The error level E_STRICT has no meaning [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reclassify_e_strict|since PHP 7.0]] after changing it to other error levels. It was left for better compatibility after an removal in [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4401|PHP 7.4]].

In theory extensions could still emit it. I propose to remove E_STRICT error level and deprecate E_STRICT constant.

==== Deprecate strtok() function ====

Author: Michael Voříšek (mvorisek)

Implementation: TODO - deprecate strtok() function thru stub

Deprecate strtok() function as it is stateful. This function is not well known/used and the stateful behaviour is very easily to be overseen, leading to a situations where it might time take to debug, especially when the strtok() calls are not closely together or even mixed within fibers - https://3v4l.org/eplIO . Another related downside is that the string is kept allocated when not fully consumed by strtok() calls making this function more or less leading. Therefore, let's deprecate this function with unwanted global state in favor or strpos, explode or preg_split functions.

==== Deprecate return invalid types for user output handler callables ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

It doesn't enforce the return type of string|false (false has special meaning here which is unfortunate) converts <php>true</php> to an empty string. Other implementation bug is suppressing the Array conversion warning due to how the outputs are being buffered/written

See https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/3126#discussion_r1460917389

==== file_put_contents() with $data as an array ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

TODO: this is surprising, not widely used, and cannot support iterable as how should an object implementing Stringable and Traversable be interpreted

==== Deprecate mysqli_refresh() ====

Author: Kamil Tekiela <dharman@php.net>

The <php>mysqli_refresh()</php> function and its OO counterpart <php>$mysqli->refresh()</php> are just a wrapper for the <php>COM_REFRESH</php> command. The <php>COM_REFRESH</php> command has been deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.
The <php>mysqli_refresh()</php> function has very easy alternatives as it's just a binary protocol version of the SQL <php>FLUSH</php> command. On top of this, the FLUSH command accepts more parameters than the COM_REFRESH command, which makes <php>mysqli_refresh()</php> the worse option of the two.

The proposal is to deprecate the <php>mysqli_refresh()</php> function and its OO counterpart, and promote usage of SQL queries, e.g. <php>FLUSH LOGS, FLUSH TABLES, FLUSH HOSTS</php> etc. 

All of the MYSQLI_REFRESH_* constants will be removed too.

==== Deprecate mysqli_kill() ====

Author: Kamil Tekiela <dharman@php.net>

The <php>mysqli_kill()</php> function and its OO counterpart <php>$mysqli->kill()</php> are just a wrapper for the <php>COM_PROCESS_KILL</php> command. The <php>COM_PROCESS_KILL</php> command has been deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.
The usage of this command is to kill a running MySQL process. It's the same as executing <php>KILL processlist_id</php> SQL statement. 

The only issue with deprecating this function in PHP is the way in which it has been used in PHP unit tests.
The <php>mysqli_kill()</php> function has been used in PHP unit tests to kill the same MySQL process that has executed the command, effectively killing itself. 
Using the <php>KILL</php> SQL command would have resulted in PHP throwing an error about interrupted connection, while using the <php>mysqli_kill()</php> function does not.
Suicidal use of this function was unlikely to be an intended use case.
There's no reason to support such behaviour from mysqli. Users who truly need this behaviour can emulate it in userland using the <php>KILL</php> statement.

The proposal is to deprecate the <php>mysqli_kill()</php> function and <php>$mysqli->kill()</php>, in favour of using the <php>KILL</php> statement.

==== Deprecate lcg_value() ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

TODO: Contradicting documentation about the returned range, catastrophic failure if the state of the underlying RNG is nulled, fallback an extremely short period if half of the state of the underlying RNG is nulled, probably biased towards larger numbers (but hard to determine for sure). There is a better replacement in Randomizer::getFloat() since PHP 8.3.

==== Deprecate uniqid() ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

TODO: Commonly misused where strong randomness is required, documentation is full of warnings. Output is effectively a transformation of the current timestamp.

Polyfill (64 bit PHP only):

<PHP>
function my_uniqid(string $prefix = '', bool $more_entropy = false) {
	static $last = null;
	do {
		$microtime = \microtime();
	} while ($microtime === $last);
	$last = $microtime;

	[$usec, $sec] = \explode(" ", $microtime, 2);
	$usec = \substr($usec, 2);
	$usec %= 0x100000;

	if ($more_entropy) {
		$seed = (((float)random_int(0, 4294967295)) / 4294967295) * 10.0;

		return \sprintf("%s%08x%05x%.8F", $prefix, $sec, $usec, $seed);
	} else {
		return \sprintf("%s%08x%05x", $prefix, $sec, $usec);
	}
}
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.4 additional deprecation notices will be emitted. The actual removal of the affected functionality will happen no earlier than PHP 9.
