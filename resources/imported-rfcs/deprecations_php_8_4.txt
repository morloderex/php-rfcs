===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.4 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * <php>DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo</php> and <php>DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo</php>
  * Soft-deprecated <php>DOMDocument</php> and <php>DOMEntity</php> properties
  * <php>DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)</php>
  * Constant <php>DOM_PHP_ERR</php>
  * <php>mysqli_ping()</php> and <php>mysqli::ping()</php>
  * <php>unserialize()</php>'s 'S' tag
  * ''session.sid_length'' and ''session.sid_bits_per_character''
  * <php>SplFixedArray::__wakeup()</php>
  * <php>xml_set_object()</php> and <php>xml_set_*_handler()</php> with string method names
  * Passing <php>null</php> and <php>false</php> to <php>dba_key_split()</php>
  * Non-numeric seed strings in xxh3
  * Constants SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING, SUNFUNCS_RET_DOUBLE, SUNFUNCS_RET_TIMESTAMP
  * Deprecate proprietary CSV escaping mechanism

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.4 and removal in PHP 9.

==== DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo and DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo ====

Author: Niels Dossche <nielsdos@php.net>

schemaTypeInfo used to be a feature of DOM Core Level 3 https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/DOM3-Core.html#core-Attr-schemaTypeInfo, but it was never implemented in PHP, i.e. it always returns NULL. That return value is not even correct, as schemaTypeInfo is not supposed to be nullable. Furthermore, the feature has been removed from the current living DOM spec. It doesn't make sense to keep a feature alive that has never been implemented and is removed by the reference specification.

==== Soft-deprecated DOMDocument and DOMEntity properties ====

The following properties have already been soft-deprecated for a long time:
  * ''DOMDocument::$actualEncoding'': it is just an alias to ''DOMDocument::$encoding''
  * ''DOMDocument::$config'': it has always returned null
  * ''DOMEntity::$actualEncoding'': it has always returned null
  * ''DOMEntity::$encoding'': it has always returned null
  * ''DOMEntity::$version'': it has always returned null

   * No

==== DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version) ====

Author: Niels Dossche <nielsdos@php.net>

<php>DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)</php> used to be a feature of DOM Core Level 3 https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/DOM3-Core.html#core-DOMImplementation3-getFeature, but it was never implemented in PHP, i.e. it always threw a "not implemented" exception. It was also never documented because of this. Furthermore, the feature has been removed from the current living DOM spec. It doesn't make sense to keep a feature alive that has never been implemented and is removed by the reference specification.

==== Constant DOM_PHP_ERR ====

==== mysqli_ping() and mysqli::ping() ====

==== unserialize()'s 'S' tag ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

Strings serialized with PHP's native serialization mechanism are represented with the (lowercase) ''s'' tag, followed by the length of the string and the raw binary representation of the string contents. During the development of the never-released PHP 6, the serialization format of binary strings [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/1f2d5e3b00d19bd6d0db40d7fc2badaa2d65082e|was changed]] to use an escaped representation for non-ASCII characters, likely to make the serialization output compatible with PHP 6's Unicode strings where not all byte sequences are valid. This escaped format was then represented with the uppercase ''S'' tag [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/7ccba6624df074051f24efabd5d88d9c0d2a8ec0|in a follow-up commit]] and support for that uppercase ''S'' tag [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/8f5310afad0eeef6f2e45a03f6ff7d4a2a7653ce|added to PHP 5]] in an attempt to provide interoperability with serialized binary strings between PHP 5 and PHP 6. This support for the uppercase ''S'' tag remains in PHP until today.

PHP's native serializer is a security-sensitive part of the standard library, the simpler the logic the smaller the chance for security issues and the easier it is to verify the code for correctness. There are no tests verifying the functionality of the uppercase ''S'' tag and no released version emitted the uppercase ''S'' tag, thus deprecating and ultimately removing the support for the ''S'' tag is exceedingly unlikely to affect anyone.

==== session.sid_length and session.sid_bits_per_character ====

TODO: https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/12418#issuecomment-1763034403

==== Deprecate SplFixedArray::__wakeup() ====

TODO: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/9704

==== xml_set_object() and xml_set_*_handler() with string method names ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The XML extension allows registering callbacks that are invoked when encountering certain XML triggers, such as the start of a new element or a processing instruction, via the relevant <php>xml_set_*_handler()</php> function.

However, these functions also allow setting a method name, as a string, that should be called on the object provided via <php>xml_set_object()</php>. This behaviour is very strange and seems to date prior to the introduction of proper callables for object methods via the <php>[$objInstance, 'methodName']</php> syntax.

The proposal is to deprecate the <php>xml_set_object()</php> function and passing non-callable strings to the <php>xml_set_*_handler()</php> functions. This would also mean to unset a handler the value of <php>null</php> must be used instead of an empty string witch is also currently allowed.

==== Deprecate passing null and false to dba_key_split() ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The signature of <php>dba_key_split()</php> is currently <php>function dba_key_split(string|false|null $key): array|false {}</php>.

However, passing <php>null</php> or <php>false</php> to this function will make it immediately return <php>false</php>,
this is the case since at least PHP 5.3, probably earlier.

Moreover, since PHP 8.0, this is the only way for this function to return <php>false</php>.

The proposal is to deprecate passing <php>null</php> and <php>false</php> to the <php>$key</php> parameter, which will allow to clean up the return type of this function in the next major version to just <php>array</php>.

==== Non-numeric seed strings in xxh3 ====

TODO: https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/10305


==== Constants SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING, SUNFUNCS_RET_DOUBLE, SUNFUNCS_RET_TIMESTAMP ====

Author: Jorg Sowa <jorg.sowa@gmail.com>

The functions <php>date_sunrise()</php>/<php>date_sunset()</php> are [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_1|already deprecated since PHP 8.1]] and will be removed in the next major version.

The proposal is to deprecate constants SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING, SUNFUNCS_RET_DOUBLE, SUNFUNCS_RET_TIMESTAMP which are used exclusively with those functions.

==== Deprecate proprietary CSV escaping mechanism ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

See: https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/3086

==== Constant E_STRICT ====

Author of implementation: mvorisek

RFC author: Jorg Sowa <jorg.sowa@gmail.com>

The error level E_STRICT has no meaning [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reclassify_e_strict|since PHP 7.0]] after changing it to other error levels. It was left for better compatibility.

Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/13053

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.4 additional deprecation notices will be emitted. The actual removal of the affected functionality will happen no earlier than PHP 9.
