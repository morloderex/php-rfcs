===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to document issues regarding the current namespace implementation, whether percieved or otherwise. 

==== Why this document ====

This document serves as summary of outstanding issues in order to aid discussion and resolution thereof.

==== Common Misconceptions ====

This document does not serve to force any particular changes in the engine regarding namespaces, as such any or all of the issues defined may at some stage 
be declared resolved without any implementation changes; It should accepted that some issues may only exist in so far that users have misinterpreted the
current namespace functionality.  

===== Issue Resolution =====

It is envisaged that all the issues raised in this document will be resolved in one of the following ways:

  - via functional changes to the current implementation
  - via the introduction of functional limitations (e.g. E_WARNING or E_FATAL errors) that alert php users to problems with there use of namespaces 
  - via user education, to this end a seperate document is being developed in order to define guidelines and 'best practices' with regard to namespaces (see: [[doc:scratchpad:namespaces]])


===== Issues =====

The following issues have been put forwards by various members of the php developers group and php users at large, the issues listed are in no particular order (this may change in the future):

**TODO! (I'm currently scouring the web/mailinglists for everything I can find) **
