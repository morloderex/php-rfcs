====== PHP RFC: #[NotSerializable] ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2023-11-26
  * Author: Max Semenik, maxsem.wiki@gmail.com
  * Status: Under discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/not_serializable

===== Introduction =====
Some classes aren't supposed to be serialized. Currently, while PHP internal classes have a nice way of preventing being serialized/unserialized, userspace doesn't. I'm proposing to make them equal.

Compare the internals simply slapping ''ce_flags |= ZEND_ACC_NOT_SERIALIZABLE'' to userspace having to do something like this:

<code php>
class MyClass
{
    public function __sleep() // Wait, what its signature is supposed to be? Does it matter?
    {
        throw new Exception('This class must not be serialized');
    }
    
    public function __wakeup()
    {
        throw new Exception('This class must not be unserialized');
    }
}
</code>

Not only is this method bulky, it's also less readable. It also lacks a way to indicate the intention to various code analysers so that they could detect attempts to serialize such classes.

===== Analysis =====
As of the time I'm writing this, there are 94 uses of ''@not-serializable'' in php-src. Examples include:
  * Closures
  * Various connections like ''PDO'', etc.
  * Reflection

What could userspace use this for?
  * Wrappers for all the above. Imagine a PDO wrapper that creates connections on demand. If the connection hasn't been established yet, its serialization will succeed, which results in unpredictable behavior.
  * Secret information that shouldn't be accidentally exfiltrated by being serialized.
  * Security-sensitive classes that are unsafe to unserialize with arbitrary data ([[https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-libs-ScopedCallback/blob/master/src/ScopedCallback.php|example in the wild]]).

===== Proposal =====
Introduce a new attribute that would expose this functionality to userspace.

<code php>
#[NotSerializable]
class MyClass
{
}

serialize(new MyClass()); // Exception: Serialization of 'MyClass' is not allowed
</code>

This change requires no changes to the engine whatsoever, all functionality is already present - it merely gets exposed to userspace.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The only breaking change is the addition of a new non-namespaced class.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.4.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Implement this RFC? (Yes/no, 2/3 approval required.)

===== Patches and Tests =====
 * Proposed PR: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12788

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
