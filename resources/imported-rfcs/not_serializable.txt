====== PHP RFC: #[NotSerializable] ======

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
Some classes aren't supposed to be serialized. Examples include closures, various connections like ''PDO'', etc. Currently, while PHP internal classes have a nice way of preventing being serialized/deserialized, userspace doesn't. I'm proposing to make them equal.

Compare the internals slapping ''ce_flags |= ZEND_ACC_NOT_SERIALIZABLE'' to userspace doing something like this:

<code php>
class MyClass
{
    public function __sleep() // Wait, what it's signature is supposed to be? Does it matter?
    {
        throw new Exception('This class must not be serialized');
    }
    
    public function __wakeup()
    {
        throw new Exception('This class must not be unserialized');
    }
}
</code>

Not only is this method bulky, it also lacks a way for various code analysers to detect attempts to serialize such classes. If course, linters may introduce their own attributes/annotations to catch such mistakes; however various linters 

===== Proposal =====
Introduce new attribute that would expose this functionality to userspace.

<code php>
#[NotSerializable]
class MyClass
{
}

serialize(new MyClass()); // Exception: Serialization of 'MyClass' is not allowed
</code>

This change requires no changes to the engine whatsoever, all functionality is already present - it merely gets exposed.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The only breaking change is the addition of a new non-namespaced class.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.4.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Implement this RFC? (Yes/no, 2/3 approval required.)
