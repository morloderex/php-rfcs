====== PHP RFC: NameOf ======

===== Introduction =====

Currently, in PHP, it is possible to get the name of nearly anything. You can retrieve the name of a class with ''get_class'' or ''::class'', you can extract the name of a function from ''(...)'', but there is one thing you cannot get the name of, and that is the name of a variable or static member during run time.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes introducing a new global function called ''nameof'' that returns the names of variables and static members. This string can assist in error messages, array keys for static/enums, or reflection. The name is extracted during compile time, and works anywhere a static string would work.

This function returns the 'name of' a variable, property, function, or static member.

====== Examples ======

''nameof($variable) === 'variable';''

''nameof($object->property) === 'property';''

''nameof(Enum::Case) === 'Case';''

''nameof(Object::Member) === 'Member';''

''nameof(func(...)) === 'func';''

''nameof(some\func(...)) === 'some\func';''

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

8.3: release
8.2.x: ''nameof'' becomes a reserved word, emitting a notice

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
Should be none

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Will existing extensions be affected? No

==== To Opcache ====
The function call is compiled to a string.

==== New Constants ====
None

===== Open Issues =====
None thus far

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
PHP will largely be unaffected by this change, except that a new global function is introduced.

===== Future Scope =====
None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
