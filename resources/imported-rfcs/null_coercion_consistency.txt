===== Introduction =====

PHP 8.1 introduced [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_null_to_scalar_internal_arg|Deprecate passing null to non-nullable arguments of internal functions]]. While the consistency introduced by the RFC is welcome (user-defined vs internal functions), for those not using //strict_types=1//, the partial breaking of NULL coercion creates an upgrade problem.

This RFC does **not** change anything for scripts using //strict_types=1//, as type checks are useful in that context. For example, developers who view NULL as a missing/invalid value (not as a value in itself), consider passing NULL to a function like //htmlspecialchars()// as something that indicates a problem for them.

Roughly **85%** scripts do not use //strict_types=1// (calculation below).

Roughly **33%** of developers use static analysis (realistically it's less than this, details below).

There was a [[https://externals.io/message/112327|short discussion]] about the original RFC, but with the exception of Craig Duncan, there was no consideration for the problems this creates with existing code (or the inconsistency of NULL coercion compared to string/int/float/bool coercion).

===== Problem =====

==== Documentation ====

According to the documentation, when **not** using //strict_types=1//, "PHP will coerce values of the wrong type into the expected scalar type declaration if possible" ([[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php#language.types.declarations.strict|ref]]).

Coercion from NULL is well defined:

  - [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php|To String]]: "null is always converted to an empty string."
  - [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php|To Integer]]: "null is always converted to zero (0)."
  - [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.float.php|To Float]]: "For values of other types, the conversion is performed by converting the value to int first and then to float"
  - [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php|To Boolean]]: "When converting to bool, the following values are considered false [...] the special type NULL"

For example:

<code php>
print('A');
print(1);
print(1.2);
print(false);
print(NULL); // Fine, coerced to empty string.

$o = [];

$o[] = ('' == '');
$o[] = ('' == NULL); // Fine, coerced to empty string.

$o[] = 'ConCat ' . 'A';
$o[] = 'ConCat ' . 123;
$o[] = 'ConCat ' . 1.2;
$o[] = 'ConCat ' . false;
$o[] = 'ConCat ' . NULL; // Fine, coerced to empty string.

$o[] = sprintf('%s', 'A');
$o[] = sprintf('%s', 1);
$o[] = sprintf('%s', 1.2);
$o[] = sprintf('%s', false);
$o[] = sprintf('%s', NULL); // Fine, coerced to empty string.

$o[] = htmlspecialchars('A');
$o[] = htmlspecialchars(1);
$o[] = htmlspecialchars(1.2);
$o[] = htmlspecialchars(false);
$o[] = htmlspecialchars(NULL); // Deprecated in 8.1, Fatal Error in 9.0?
</code>

With user-defined functions, while this does not cause a backwards compatibility issue (details below), it still highlights the coercion inconsistency, and that some type checking is happening in an environment that does not expect type checking:

<code php>
function user_function(string $s, int $i, float $f, bool $b) {
  var_dump($s, $i, $f, $b);
}

user_function('1', '1', '1', '1');
  // string(1) "1" / int(1) / float(1) / bool(true)

user_function(2, 2, 2, 2);
  // string(1) "2" / int(2) / float(2) / bool(true)

user_function(3.3, 3.3, 3.3, 3.3);
  // string(3) "3.3" / int(3) / float(3.3) / bool(true)

user_function(false, false, false, false);
  // string(0) "" / int(0) / float(0) / bool(false)

user_function(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
  // Uncaught TypeError x4?
</code>

Arrays, Resources, and Objects (without //__toString()//) cannot be coerced (for fairly obvious reasons).

String/Int/Float/Bool can be coerced.

NULL can usually be coerced, but...

  - PHP 7.0 introduced the ability for user-defined functions to specify parameter types via the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5#behaviour_of_weak_type_checks|Scalar Type Declarations RFC]], where the focus was on //strict_types=1//. But the implementation also caused Type Errors when not using //strict_types=1//, which seems more of an over-sight, with coercion working for string/int/float/bool but not null (despite the documentation), and introducing a type check (for an environment that does not expect this).
  - PHP 8.1 continued this inconsistency with internal functions.

==== Examples ====

Common sources of NULL:

<code php>
$search = (isset($_GET['q']) ? $_GET['q'] : NULL);

$search = ($_GET['q'] ?? NULL); // Since PHP 7

$search = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'q');

$search = $request->input('q'); // Laravel
$search = $request->get('q'); // Symfony
$search = $this->request->getQuery('q'); // CakePHP
$search = $request->getGet('q'); // CodeIgniter

$value = array_pop($empty_array);
$value = mysqli_fetch_row($result);
$value = json_decode($json); // Invalid JSON, or nesting limit.
</code>

Examples where NULL has previously been fine for scripts not using //strict_types=1//:

<code php>
$search_trimmed = trim($search);

$search_len = strlen($search);

$search_upper = strtoupper($search);

$search_hash = hash('sha256', $search);

echo htmlspecialchars($search);

echo 'https://example.com/?q=' . urlencode($search);

preg_match('/^[a-z]/', $search);

exec('/path/to/cmd ' . escapeshellarg($search));

socket_write($socket, $search);

xmlwriter_text($writer, $search);
</code>

And developers have used //NULL// to skip certain parameters, e.g.

<code php>
setcookie('q', $search, NULL, NULL, NULL, true, true); // x4

mail('nobody@example.com', 'subject', 'message', NULL, '-fwebmaster@example.com');
</code>

There are approximately [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-allow-null-rfc/blob/main/functions-change.md|335 parameters affected by this deprecation]].

As an aside, there are also roughly [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-allow-null-rfc/blob/main/functions-maybe.md|104 questionable]] and [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-allow-null-rfc/blob/main/functions-other.md|558 problematic]] parameters which probably shouldn't accept NULL **or** an Empty String. For these parameters, a different RFC could consider updating them to reject both NULL and Empty Strings, e.g. //$needle// in //strpos()//, and //$characters// in //trim()//; in the same way that //$separator// in //explode()// already has a "cannot be empty" Fatal Error.

==== Finding ====

The only realistic way for developers to find when NULL is passed to these internal functions is to use the deprecation notices (not ideal).

It is possible to use very strict Static Analysis, to follow every variable from source to sink (to check if a variable could be //NULL//), but most developers are not in a position to do this (i.e. not using static analysis, or not at a high enough level, or they are using a baseline to ignore).

In the last JetBrains developer survey, where 67% regularly used Laravel, **only 33% used Static Analysis** ([[https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/php/#PHP_do-you-use-static-analysis|source]]); where it's fair to say many still would not identify these possible NULL values.

As an example, take this simple script:

<code php>
./src/index.php
<?php
$nullable = ($_GET['a'] ?? NULL);
echo htmlentities($nullable);
?>
</code>

It's considered fine today by the relevant tools:

<code cli>
composer require --dev vimeo/psalm
./vendor/bin/psalm --init ./src/ 4
./vendor/bin/psalm
No errors found!
</code>
Note: Psalm can detect this problem at [[https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/error_levels/|levels 1, 2, and 3]] (don't use a baseline).

<code cli>
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -l 9 ./src/

</code>

<code cli>
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules
composer require --dev phpstan/extension-installer
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -l 9 ./src/
[OK] No errors
</code>
Note: There are [[https://phpstan.org/config-reference#stricter-analysis|Stricter Analysis]] options for PHPStan, but they don't seem to help with this problem.

<code cli>
composer require --dev rector/rector
./vendor/bin/rector init
./vendor/bin/rector process ./src/
[OK] Rector is done!

<code cli>

</code>

Note: Juliette (@jrfnl) has confirmed that getting PHPCompatibility to solve this problem will be "pretty darn hard to do" because it's "not reliably sniffable" ([[https://twitter.com/jrf_nl/status/1497937320766496772|source]]).

==== Temporary Solutions ====

You can disable //E_DEPRECATED// (as recommended by projects like WordPress).

Alternatively you can use //set_error_handler()//, with something like:

<code php>
function ignore_null_coercion($errno, $errstr) {
  // https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/012ef7912a8a0bb7d11b2dc8d108cc859c51e8d7/Zend/zend_API.c#L458
  if ($errno === E_DEPRECATED && preg_match('/Passing null to parameter #.* of type .* is deprecated/', $errstr)) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
set_error_handler('ignore_null_coercion', E_DEPRECATED);
</code>

And some developers are simply [[https://externals.io/message/116519#116559|patching php-src]] (risky).

==== Updating ====

While making each change is fairly easy - they are difficult to find, there are many of them (time consuming), and the updates used are often pointless, e.g.

  * //urlencode(strval($name));//
  * //urlencode((string) $name);//
  * //urlencode($name ?? "");//

One example diff didn't exactly make the code easier to read:

<code diff>
 - $result = substr($string, 0, $length);
 + $result = substr($string ?? '', 0, $length);
</code>

As noted above - PHPCompatibility, CodeSniffer, Rector, etc are unable to find or update these cases.

===== Proposal =====

No change for those using //strict_types=1//.

Must keep the spirit of the original RFC, and keep user-defined and internal functions consistent.

Revert the deprecation of NULL coercion when **not** using //strict_types=1//, to work as documented, be consistent with scalar types, and (most importantly) avoid the upgrade problems (i.e. Fatal Errors for PHP 9.0).

For consistency, change user-defined functions to allow NULL to be coerced when **not** using //strict_types=1//.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.2

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None known

==== To Existing Extensions ====

None known

==== To Opcache ====

None known

===== Open Issues =====

"terrible idea" - I'm still waiting to hear details.

"it's a bit late" - We only have a deprecation at the moment (which can and is being ignored), it will be "too late" when PHP 9.0 uses Fatal Errors.

===== Future Scope =====

Some function parameters could be updated to rase a Fatal Error when //NULL// **or** //Empty String// is provided; e.g.

  - //$needle// in [[https://php.net/strpos|strpos()]]
  - //$characters// in [[https://php.net/trim|trim()]]
  - //$method// in [[https://php.net/method_exists|method_exists()]]
  - //$json// in [[https://php.net/json_decode|json_decode()]]

===== Rejected Features =====

Did consider updating some parameters to accept NULL ([[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/allow_null|details]]).

===== Notes =====

The **85%** of scripts that do not use //strict_types=1// was calculated using [[https://grep.app/|grep.app]], to "search across a half million git repos", were each result is a script (not a count of matches,  [[https://grep.app/search?q=defuse/php-encryption&filter[lang][0]=PHP|example]]). We can see [[https://grep.app/search?q=strict_types&filter[lang][0]=PHP|269,701]] scripts using //strict_types=1//, out of [[https://grep.app/search?q=php&filter[lang][0]=PHP|1,830,411]]. And keep in mind that [[https://grep.app/search?q=class%20wpdb%20%7B&filter[lang][0]=PHP|WordPress only really appears once]], it is [[https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/10/wordpress-5-9-and-php-8-0-8-1/#php-8-1-deprecation-passing-null-to-non-nullable-php-native-functions-parameters|affected by this deprecation]], and is installed/used by many.

In the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5#behaviour_of_weak_type_checks|Scalar Type Declarations]] RFC for PHP 7.0, scalar types were defined as "int, float, string and bool" - but, despite NULL also being a simple value (i.e. not an array/object/resource), it was not included in this definition. For backwards compatibility reasons this definition is unlikely to change.

Also, note the example quote from [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/71525|Rasmus]]:

> PHP is and should remain:
> 1) a pragmatic web-focused language
> 2) a loosely typed language
> 3) a language which caters to the skill-levels and platforms of a wide range of users
