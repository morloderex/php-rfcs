====== PHP RFC: PHP Technical Committee ======
  * Version: 0.1

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

PHP uses voting system for deciding about changes to PHP. This was created mainly for user visible
changes in language. It works well for that purpose but it is not that effective for deciding about
purely technical changes that impact PHP internals and extension API's. It is not exactly clear how
it should resolve conflicts (on technical bases) between contributors that sometimes happen.


===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes introduction of the PHP Technical Committee that would decide about all technical
aspects of php-src if there is a disagreement between contributors.


==== Definitions ====

; contributor : Anyone who has already contributed to php-src.
; php-src : Source code in https://github.com/php/php-src/
