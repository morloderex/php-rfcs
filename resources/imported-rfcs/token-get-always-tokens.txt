====== PHP RFC: token_get_all() flag to return consistent elements ======

===== Introduction =====
token_get_all() returns an array of tokens where each token element is either a single-character (for single-character tokens), or an array describing the token's ID, line number, and text content.  For example, token_get_all("<?php ;") returns:

  Array (
    [0] => Array (
      [0] => int(374)
      [1] => string(6)"<?php "
      [2] => int(1)
    )
    [1] => string(1)";"
  ) 

This makes writing tools which use the scanner awkward, and it actually hides scanner info (The line number, stored in sub-element [2]).

===== Proposal =====
This proposal aims to normalize the output of token_get_all (when requested) by always using associative arrays as the sub-elements in the output.  For example, token_get_all("<?php ;", TOKEN_FULL) would output:

  Array (
    [0] => Array (
      [token] => int(374)
      [text] => string(6)"<?php "
      [line] => int(1)
    )
    [1] => Array (
      [token] => int(59)  // 59 == ord(';')
      [text] => string(1) ";"
      [line] => int(1)
    )
  ) 

Note the use of a new constant TOKEN_FULL to be used with the flags parameter introduced in PHP 7.0

==== New Constants ====
TOKEN_FULL - When present, token_get_all() will use the new format

===== Future Scope =====
Possibly add additional fields such as character position, tokenizer state, etc...

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Introduce TOKEN_FULL and new scanner output format? 50% majority required
