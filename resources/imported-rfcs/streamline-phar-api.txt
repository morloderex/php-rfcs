====== Request for comments: Streamline Phar API ======
===== Abstract =====
This proposal aims to streamline the Phar API to make it more usable and intuitive. 
===== Concrete change proposals =====

==== SplFileInfo ====
=== setContent/getContent ===
== Proposal ==
Add two simple methods to write/retrieve content.
== Code ==
<code php>
$file = new SplFileInfo("file");
$file->setContent('foo');
echo $file->getContent(); // returns 'foo'
</code>
=== get*Time() methods ===
== Related methods ==
  * getMTime()
  * getATime()
  * getCTime()
== Proposal ==
Rename the methods to make them more independent from their origin, the UNIX naming scheme and therefore better to understand for a people with non-UNIX backgrounds. Leave the original method names but throw deprecated warnings for PHP 6.
  * getMTime() => getModificationTime()
  * getATime() => getAccessTime()
  * getCTime() => getCreateTime()

==== PharFileInfo ====
=== setCompressed*() methods ===
== Related methods ==
   * setCompressedBZIP2()
   * setCompressedGZ()
   * setUncompressed()
== Proposal ==
Unify this methods to a single method compress(). The compress method will take one argument indicating the compression algorithm. The compression algorithm is represented as a Phar class constant. The setUncompressed() method should be renamed to uncompress().
== Code ==
<code php>
$file->compress(Phar::BZIP2); // Compress with bzip2
$file->compress(Phar::GZIP);  // Compress with gzip
$file->uncompress();
</code>
=== isCompressed*() methods ===
== Related methods ==
  * isCompressedBZIP2()
  * isCompressedGZ()
  * isCompressed()
== Proposal ==
Unify this methods to one PharFileInfo::isCompressed(). The new isCompressed() would take an optional argument with the compression algorithm. The compression algorithm is represented as a Phar class constant.
== Code ==
<code php>
$file->isCompressed(); // Is the file compressed at all?
$file->isCompressed(Phar::GZIP); // Is the file gzip compressed?
$file->isCompressed(Phar::BZIP2); // Is the file bzip compressed?
