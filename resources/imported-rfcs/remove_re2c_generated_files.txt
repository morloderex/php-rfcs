====== PHP RFC: Remove re2c generated files ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-01-18 (use today's date here)
  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft


===== Introduction =====
Currently our git repo contains files like zend_language_scanner.c, zend_ini_scanner.c, etc which are files generated by re2c. Historically these files have been included because re2c was not available on many platforms. However re2c is now available almost on every platform and this argument is no longer valid. It's also not possible to compile PHP without re2c installed (there is an AC_PROG check for re2c).

On the other hand the files generated by bison are NOT in the repository. That means an inconsistency in our approach of having generated files in the repository.

The removal of these files would prevent possible conflicts that often happens when two people edit re2c generated files.

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to remove re2c generated files from the git repository.
