===== Introduction =====
Raising a number to the power of a negative number is equivalent to taking the reciprocal of the number raised to the positive opposite of the power.

If we raise the number zero to the power of a negative number we end up with the one divided by zero, which gives an undefined result. Currently in PHP, such operation results in `INF`, while explicit division by zero gives a DivisionByZeroError.

<code php>
var_dump(0 ** -1); //float(INF)

var_dump(pow(0,-1)); //float(INF)

var_dump(1/0); //DivisionByZeroError: Division by zero

</code>

===== Proposal =====
The RFC proposes to change the behavior of this operation to match the division by zero operation. In the next minor version such an operation will throw a Deprecation notice, and for the major version, this operation will throw DivisionByZeroError.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This change will break all code including raising the zero number to a negative power.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Deprecation Notice in the next minor PHP version 8.4.

Throwing DivisionByZeroError in the next major PHP version: 9.0.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As per the voting RFC, a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started 2024-x-x and closed 2024-x-x.
