====== PHP RFC: New operator for context-dependent escaping ======
  * Version: 0.9

  * Status: Draft (or Under Discussion or Accepted or Declined)
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/escaping_operator

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes the addition of new operator for context-dependent escaping. This operator is intended mainly for HTML escaping but it allows to add handlers for other contexts. This operator requires new syntax, so it requires the changes in the language parser.


===== Main arguments 'for' and 'against' =====

  * You can write short function in userland

The problem is not that we have no function. The problem is that the same action is always repeated, and if we don't repeat it then it leads to security problems. More than 90% of output data - is data from DB and must be HTML-encoded.

Both variants <php><?= h($something) ?></php> and <php><?= $something ?></php> work good. But the second variant is unsafe. One is a subset of another, we have the same beginning <?= and then can write helper function or not. It is easy to forget to write that main part.

With new operator we can write or <?* ?>, or <?= ?>, they are mutually exclusive, and we need specially write one or another.

Also there is a problem with function autoloading.

  * It is no place for such operators in the language

It is no place for a such operators in C++, or C#, or Java. But in the most popular language for web-programming it is very place for such operator.
Even in the PHP source code the content outside the PHP tags is designated as T_INLINE_HTML, not just T_EXTERNAL_CONTENT.\\ 
[[https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/8f39293b867ced224ae72d512f3e543b6e039bc8/Zend/zend_language_scanner.l#L1838|zend_language_scanner.l]]

Maybe it would be better if operator <?= ?> performs HTML escaping, and raw data is output via <?php echo ?>
Maybe if there were not operators for switching context between PHP and HTML, escaping operator would not be needed.
But that is exactly what made PHP what it is.
It is necessary or remove these operators completely or make them more safer and useful.

And we already have such operator in the language - `backticks` for shell_exec().

===== Conclusion =====
This small change can really improve a security in many applications.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 7.x" or "next PHP 7.x.y".

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Will existing extensions be affected?

==== To Opcache ====
It is necessary to develop RFC's with opcache in mind, since opcache is a core extension distributed with PHP.

Please explain how you have verified your RFC's compatibility with opcache.

==== New Constants ====
Describe any new constants so they can be accurately and comprehensively explained in the PHP documentation.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

State whether this project requires a 2/3 or 50%+1 majority (see [[voting]])

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
