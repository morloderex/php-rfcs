  * Date: 2020-06-03
  * Author: Theodore Brown <theodorejb@outlook.com>, Martin Schr√∂der
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Discussion: https://externals.io/message/110355
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Implementation for ''@@'': Based on https://github.com/kooldev/php-src/pull/2 (requires a single character to be changed in the lexer and a small grammar adjustment)
  * Implementation for ''#[]'': https://github.com/koolkode/php-src/pull/5

===== Introduction =====

We propose to use ''@@Attr'' or ''#[Attr]'' as the attribute syntax in PHP 8.0 instead of ''%%<<Attr>>%%''.

==== Background ====

Early last month, the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2|Attributes v2]] RFC was accepted for PHP 8.0. During voting there was a syntax choice between ''%%<<Attr>>%%'' and ''@:Attr'', and the former was preferred by an approximately 3/4 majority.

However, this syntax has several noteworthy shortcomings:

==== 1. Verbosity ====

In this example from the RFC, there are more characters used for the ''%%<<%%'' and ''%%>>%%'' tokens than for the attribute name itself:

<code php>
<<Jit>>
function foo() {}
</code>

Especially once more than one attribute needs to be added, the syntax can get quite noisy and difficult to read at a glance. To alleviate this, the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments|Attribute Amendments]] RFC proposes to allow grouping multiple attributes between one pair of ''%%<<%%'' and ''%%>>%%'' tokens:

<code php>
<<Attr1("foo"),
  Attr2("bar")>>
public function test() {}
</code>

Unfortunately, this results in another problem: adding a new attribute at the start or end of the list, or removing one of the attributes, will require modifying multiple lines, which adds noise to diffs. Notably, the proposal does allow trailing commas, so the code could be written like this instead:

<code php>
<<
  Attr1("foo"),
  Attr2("bar"),
>>
public function test() {}
</code>

But now two extra lines are needed for the ''%%<<%%'' and ''%%>>%%'' tokens, and multiple lines will likely still be modified when moving from one attribute to two attributes, or vice versa.

==== 2. Lack of nested attributes ====

Nested annotations are quite common in apps using Doctrine. Here's an example [[https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.7/reference/association-mapping.html#mapping-defaults|from the documentation]]:

<code>
@JoinTable(
    name="User_Group",
    joinColumns={@JoinColumn(name="User_id", referencedColumnName="id")},
    inverseJoinColumns={@JoinColumn(name="Group_id", referencedColumnName="id")}
)
</code>

While nested attributes with the ''%%<<>>%%'' syntax should technically be possible, there was general agreement among the implementers that this approach crosses a line of unacceptable ugliness. For example:

<code php>
<<JoinTable(
    "User_Group",
    <<JoinColumn("User_id", "id")>>,
    <<JoinColumn("Group_id", "id")>>,
)>>
private $groups;
</code>

A somewhat more readable approach would be to allow ''new Attr()'' expressions for nested attributes:

<code php>
<<JoinTable(
    "User_Group",
    new JoinColumn("User_id", "id"),
    new JoinColumn("Group_id", "id"),
)>>
private $groups;
</code>

The downside of this is that it can lead to confusion about which expressions are supported (e.g. ''new Foo()'' would be allowed but ''Foo::create()'' wouldn't work). Furthermore, it turned out to be very difficult to implement this, and the feature was ultimately given up on since it would require a lot of changes to const expressions.

==== 3. Confusion with generics ====

Although there isn't technically a conflict between the syntax for attributes and generics, once generics are supported in PHP it may be harder to tell at a glance where generics are being used as opposed to attributes.

==== 4. Confusion with shift operators and const arguments ====

Reusing shift tokens can make it difficult to tell if a line contains multiple attributes, or a shift operator in a constant expression:

<code php>
<<Bar(2 * (3 + 3)>>Baz, (4 + 5) * 2)>>
function foo() {}
</code>

Of course, bit shifts will rarely be used in this context. However, for developers who are used to working with shift operators, reusing the same syntax to delineate attributes may still result in less readable code due to this association. Furthermore, if the grouped attribute proposal is accepted, there can be similar confusion between comma separated attributes and attribute arguments:

<code php>
<<Attr1(2 * 3 + 3), Bar(4 + 5 * 2)>>
<<Attr2(2 * (3 + 3), Baz, (4 + 5) * 2)>>
function foo() {}
</code>

==== 5. Dissimilarity to other languages ====

Most other languages in the C family use either ''[Attr]'' or ''@Attr'' for their attribute syntax, requiring just one or two characters, rather than four (see comparison further below).


===== Proposal =====

Use ''@@Attr'' instead of ''%%<<Attr>>%%'' for the attribute syntax in PHP 8.0 (using a new ''T_ATTRIBUTE'' token).

This solves each of the above issues. It requires half as many characters, reducing verbosity in line with most other languages that have attributes:

<code php>
@@Jit
function foo() {}
</code>

The ''@@'' syntax doesn't have any conflicts with nested attributes, so it will be straightforward to add support for them in the future if desired (without needing any special cases or changes to const expressions):

<code php>
@@JoinTable(
    "User_Group",
    @@JoinColumn("User_id", "id"),
    @@JoinColumn("Group_id", "id"),
)
private $groups;
</code>

The shorter syntax can also improve code readability by making it easier to tell at a glance where attributes are used as opposed to generics or shift operators. Lastly, it avoids the problem of needing to modify multiple lines when adding or removing a single attribute:

<code php>
@@Attr1("foo")
@@Attr2("bar") // this line can be added or removed independent of other lines
public function test() {}
</code>

A small side benefit of the ''@@'' syntax is the ability to easily grep for attributes. Besides being used as a shift operator, ''%%<<%%'' also occurs in heredocs/nowdocs which would add noise to simple attribute searches.

==== Additional examples ====

So far the RFC has shown attributes on functions, methods, and class properties. For completeness, here's how the proposed syntax looks with classes (or interfaces or traits), class constants, parameters, anonymous classes, and closures:

<code php>
@@ExampleAttribute
class Foo
{
    @@ExampleAttribute
    public const FOO = 'foo';

    public function foo(@@ExampleAttribute Type $bar) {}
}

$object = new @@ExampleAttribute class () {};

$f1 = @@ExampleAttribute function () {};

$f2 = @@ExampleAttribute fn() => 1;
</code>

===== Discussion =====

==== Why was the "@:" syntax rejected? ====

One argument against it was that it is more prone to accidental typos like ''@;''. Another reason that some people disliked it is that it's non-symmetrical, and thus doesn't fit well with existing PHP tokens. The ''@@'' syntax avoids both of these issues.

==== Will the "@" character make attributes hard to read? ====

It has been suggested that the ''@'' character could run into other wide characters like ''M'', making attributes starting with that letter harder to read. However, in practice this hasn't been an issue for the many other languages that use the ''@Attr'' syntax. This concern is largely dependent on font choice and syntax highlighting.

==== Will the lack of a closing >> delineater make inline attributes less readable? ====

There was a concern that it could be harder to tell where an inline attribute ends without a closing ''%%>>%%'' token. However, for inline class and function attributes, the ''class''/''function'' keyword already provides a clear delineater.

For parameter attributes, this ends up being a bit subjective. Some see ''%%>>%%'' as clearly marking the end of an attribute, while others find that the ''%%>>%%'' looks like a shift operator at first glance which makes the syntax harder to read:

<code php>
function foo(
    <<MyAttr("val")>> Type $myParam,
) {}

// vs.

function foo(
    @@MyAttr("val") Type $myParam,
) {}
</code>

==== Why not use a keyword instead? ====

It has been suggested that a keyword be used instead of a symbol. E.g.

<code php>
attribute Foo();
function myFunc() {}
</code>

However, the objective of this proposal is to arrive at a syntax that is less verbose and aligns better with the attribute syntax used in other common languages. Using a keyword doesn't meet either of these goals.

==== Isn't the syntax choice just something subjective we'll get used to? ====

To some extent this may be true. However, in this case we believe there are also objective reasons to prefer the shorter syntax, which this RFC attempts to outline.


===== Comparison to other languages =====

Most other languages with attributes use a variant of ''[Attr]'' or ''@Attr'' for the syntax. Hack is the only language using ''%%<<Attr>>%%'', but apparently they are migrating away from this to ''@Attr'' now that compatibility with PHP is no longer a goal.

  * C#: ''[Attr]'' [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/|1]]
  * C++: ''%%[[attr]]%%'' [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/attributes?view=vs-2019|2]]
  * Hack: ''%%<<Attr>>%%'' [[https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/attributes/attribute-specification|3]] (but migrating to ''@Attr'') [[https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/a3f65737996e151ca2f25b3a335b89ef665c75cd|4]]
  * Java: ''@Attr'' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation|5]]
  * Kotlin: ''@Attr'' [[https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/annotations.html|6]]
  * Python: ''@attr'' [[https://pythonbasics.org/decorators/|7]]
  * Rust: ''#[attr]'' [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html|8]]
  * Swift: ''@attr'' [[https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html|9]]
  * TypeScript/JS: ''@Attr'' [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html|10]]

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

In theory there is a small BC break, since multiple error suppression operators can currently be added with no additional effect (e.g. ''@@@@@really_suppress_me()''). However, this isn't useful for anything and is very unlikely to be used anywhere.

===== Alternative #[] syntax =====

An alternative to using ''@@Attr'' would be to borrow Rust's ''#[attr]'' syntax for attributes. This would also present a backwards compatibility break, since it would no longer be possible to begin a hash style comment with a left bracket:

<code php>
#[x] code like this would break
$val = ['new value']; #['old value'];
</code>

==== Pros ====
  * Reuses the exact same syntax as another C family language.
  * Retains a closing delineater to mark the end of the attribute.
  * Potentially forwards compatible for single-line attributes.

For example, code like this would work on PHP 7 and PHP 8:

<code php>
/** @ORM\Entity */
#[ORM\Entity]
class User {}
</code>

However, it's not clear this would be very useful in most cases, since the docblock annotation for PHP 7 is //already// forward compatible with PHP 8. Rather than duplicating attributes and trying to keep them in sync, libraries would likely stick with docblock annotations until they need to depend on other PHP 8 features like union types, and then migrate entirely to the native attribute syntax.

One potentially useful scenario would be to allow running unit tests on multiple versions of PHPUnit (e.g. PHPUnit 11 using native attributes and PHPUnit 10 using docblocks) for libraries that need to support both PHP 7 and PHP 8 long term. However, this benefit will still eventually lose relevance as more users and libraries migrate to PHP 8, and it may be difficult to support multiple versions of PHPUnit like this anyway due to other breaking changes between versions.

==== Cons ====

  * Larger BC break than ''@@''. While duplicate error suppression operators aren't useful, there is a use for comments starting with a left bracket (e.g. for making checkboxes, or to comment out an array). There is definitely code in the wild using using this syntax. [[https://grep.app/search?q=%23%5B&filter[lang][0]=PHP|11]]
  * It's slightly more verbose than ''@@'', which works against one of the goals of this RFC.
  * Arguably more difficult to type than ''@@'' on common QWERTY keyboard layouts.

==== Additional examples with #[] ====

<code ecmascript>
#[Jit]
function foo() {}

class Foo
{
    #[ExampleAttribute]
    public const FOO = 'foo';

    // with potential nesting in future
    #[JoinTable(
        "User_Group",
        #[JoinColumn("User_id", "id")],
        #[JoinColumn("Group_id", "id")],
    )]
    private $groups;

    #[ExampleAttribute]
    public function foo(#[ExampleAttribute] Type $bar) {}
}

$object = new #[ExampleAttribute] class () {};

$f1 = #[ExampleAttribute] function () {};

$f2 = #[ExampleAttribute] fn() => 1;
</code>

===== Unaffected Functionality =====

Attributes can still be applied to all the same places outlined in the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2|Attributes v2]] RFC. Non-syntactical attribute functionality also remains unchanged (e.g. the reflection API).

Finally, this proposal does not conflict with the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments|Attribute Amendments]] RFC, with the exception that if the ''@@'' or ''#[]'' syntax is accepted, it will supersede the syntax for grouped attributes.
