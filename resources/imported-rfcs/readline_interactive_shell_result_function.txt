====== PHP RFC: Configurable callback to dump results of expressions in `php -a` ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2020-12-19
  * Author: Tyson Andre, tandre@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5962/files
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readline_interactive_shell_result_function

===== Introduction =====

Many REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops) for other programming languages that I'm familiar with print a (possibly truncated) representation of the result of expressions, but PHP doesn't.
It would be useful to allow users to extend the functionality of the default interactive php shell (''php -a''), possibly with ''auto_prepend_file'' or through use of command wrappers/aliases, or after loading the shell.
Prior to this RFC, there was no way to extend the interactive php shell in this way.
(I've seen https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh mentioned as an alternative for ''php -a'' while investigating this, but that's a shell written from scratch, and doesn't have some functionality from ''php -a'' such as tolerance of fatal errors)

Because PHP's interactive shell is written in C, adding new features or bug fixes would require a lot of time getting familiar with
C programming, PHP's internals and memory management, and with PHP's internal C ast representation. It would be easier and more accessible to extend PHP's interactive shell through code written in PHP rather than code written in C.

===== Proposal =====

Add a new function ''readline_interactive_shell_result_function'' when starting an interactive PHP session with ''php -a''. This function only affects interactive shells - it can be used to set or clear a closure when ''extension_loaded('readline') === true'', but that closure would only be called in interactive shells (i.e. ''php -a'').

Using this, users or applications can configure callables to be run every time a statement containing a single expression such as ''2+2;'' or ''$x = call_function();'' is evaluated (but not non-expressions such as ''class X{}'' or combinations of expressions such as ''$x = 1; $y = $x*2;''. A very basic example of using this would be:

<code php>
php -a
Interactive shell

php > readline_interactive_shell_result_function(
php (     function (string $code, $result) {
php (         echo "Saw " . trim($code) . "\n";
php (         echo json_encode($result);
php (     });
php > 2+2;
Saw 2+2;
4
</code>

Real implementations may be much more complex, and make use of parsers such as https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser or https://github.com/nikic/php-ast to check if the expression in question is an assignment, call to print(), etc.

This has the following signature:
<code php>
/**
 * When $callback is a callback, replaces the old callback used to dump expression results.
 * When $callback is null, removes the callback used to dump expression results.
 *
 * Currently, this always returns true, but future changes to the implementation
 * may make it return false.
 */
function readline_interactive_shell_result_function(?callable $callback): bool;
</code>

A new system ini boolean setting ''cli.enable_interactive_shell_result_function'' is added as part of this RFC, defaulting to enabled. It can be disabled to prevent the closures from being called on expression results, e.g. if the closures have bugs, are excessivly verbose, or have unpredictable performance.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None, only interactive sessions are affected, and only when this functionality is enabled and a callback is installed.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
This functionality is available in interactive CLI sessions. Other SAPIs are unaffected.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values: ''cli.enable_interactive_shell_result_function = On''
  * php.ini-development values: ''cli.enable_interactive_shell_result_function = On'' (or omitted, cli.pager and cli.prompt currently exist but not documented in those files)
  * php.ini-production values: ''cli.enable_interactive_shell_result_function = On''

===== Future Scope =====

==== Providing a default callback to dump expression results ====

This RFC is minimal and does not provide a default implementation for rendering values of expressions (i.e. there is no callback by default). Providing a default is feasible, but there are a variety of choices that could be made (e.g. var_dump vs var_export vs shorter JSON-like equivalents for simple arrays, handling of recursive data structures, truncating output, etc).

  * In order to provide more extensive default handlers for tab completion and rendering of evaluated expressions, it may be useful to bundle a parser written in php with the interactive shell. The heuristics currently written in C are very limited and not aware of context beyond the most recent tokens.

From https://externals.io/message/111073#111073
<blockquote>
Miscellaneous thoughts on implementation details:

  * Bundling an actual parser (e.g. https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) would help in properly analyzing ''Foo::$var-><TAB>''
by being less reliant on heuristics (e.g. checking if the token ''$var'' was a variable or a property, making it easier to collect local variables, etc).

Is packaging a parser practical for a ''phpi'' binary (e.g. for package managers, maintainers of php, other reasons)?

  * A parser may fail for code using new token types until the parser gets updated to handle the new token types. This stops being a concern after feature freezes. \\ Looping over ''@token_get_all()'' and bailing out on an unknown token type may help with that.
  * How would crash/bug fixes of phpi or the parser be handled in patch releases of php if this was released with php?
  * Automatically rewriting the code to namespace the parser and its dependencies with ''\PHP\Internal\BundledPhpParser'' would let ''phpi'' be used with projects that depend on a different php-parser version. \\ (clarifications may be necessary to indicate to end users that the bundled parser copy won't get updates or support outside of php minor releases, should not be used by libraries/applications and that it won't support newer php syntax, and possibly other things)
</blockquote>

==== Supporting rendering the last expression in a list of statements ====

This was left out to simplify the implementation, but is probably doable by rewriting the C AST before evaluating the snippet for safe node kinds.

  * i.e. change ''foo(); bar();'' to ''foo(); return (bar());''
