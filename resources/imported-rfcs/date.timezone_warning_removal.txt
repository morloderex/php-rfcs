===== Introduction =====
Each time we use date() or generally functions which make use of the date.timezone ini setting, we get a warning. Even when only just trying to try something small with PHP cli involving dates, especially without a default php.ini installed, we can't just get nice output without an annoying warning.

Thus, I'd like to remove this warning in favor of a better user experience.

===== Proposal =====
Removing the date.timezone warning in case the date.timezone ini setting is empty.

The date.timezone warning has this text:

It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Targeting the next minor version.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
If the date.timezone ini setting is set but invalid, a warning is still thrown.
The default is and remains UTC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Remove this warning (50%+1 vote):
  * Yes
  * No

===== Patch =====
