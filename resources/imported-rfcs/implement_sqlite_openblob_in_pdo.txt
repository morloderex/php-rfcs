====== PHP RFC: Implement missing SQLite feature "openBlob" in PDO ======

===== Introduction =====

The "SQLite" driver of PDO is missing some features provided by the "SQLite3" extension, namely "openBlob" which allows to access a stored blob as a stream/file pointer.

===== Proposal =====

As discussed on [[https://externals.io/message/100268|internals]] the SQLite driver of PDO is missing some features that are present in the SQLite3 extension.

One of those features has already been proposed and merged: [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2734|Add support for SQLite open flags]].

A second one has been proposed and is awaiting merging: [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2760|Implement sqlite_stmt_readonly in PDO]]

But we are still missing this feature: [[https://secure.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.openblob.php|SQLite3::openBlob]]: opening blobs for reading and writing as streams.

This would be implemented following the current practice of adding a driver-specific method:

''PDO::sqliteOpenBlob(string $table , string $column , int $rowid [, string $dbname = "main" [, int $flags = PDO::SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY ]] )''

This would return a resource file pointer. This would match exactly the behaviour of [[https://secure.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.openblob.php|SQLite3::openBlob]].

This is following what already exists in PDO, examples:

  * Creating a LOB in Postgre: [[https://secure.php.net/manual/en/pdo.pgsqllobcreate.php|PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate]]
  * Creating a function in SQLite: [[https://secure.php.net/manual/en/pdo.sqlitecreatefunction.php|PDO::sqliteCreateFunction]]
