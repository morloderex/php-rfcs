  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

tbd

===== Proposal =====

tbd

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

==== Addition of a new exception class ====

The UnserializationFailedException will no longer be available. The query <code>symbol:UnserializationFailedException language:php</code> in GitHub's Code Search did not return any non-namespaced results, making this a theoretical issue.

==== Existing error handling for unserialize() might need to be updated. ====

tbd

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Existing extensions should update their error handling in the unserialize handlers to emit an error message that is most useful to the user.


==== To Opcache ====

None.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====


Anything that does not interact with <php>unserialize()</php>. Developers who interact with <php>__unserialize()</php>, <php>__wakeup()</php>, and <php>Serializable::unserialize()</php> might affected depending on what exactly they are doing with those.

===== Future Scope =====

None.
