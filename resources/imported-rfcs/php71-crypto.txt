===== Introduction =====
Cryptography is hard to get right, even for experts. Building atop the victories against insecure design that the password hashing API have brought us, I would seek to provide a simple, secure-by-default cryptography interface that puts as little burden on the user (PHP developers) as possible, that works with multiple cryptography backends.
