====== PHP RFC: Deprecate ${} string interpolation ======

  * Date: 2021-03-13
  * Author: Ilija Tovilo, tovilo.ilija@gmail.com
  * Status: Under discussion
  * Target Version: PHP 8.2
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/8212

===== Proposal =====

PHP allows embedding variables in strings with double-quotes (''%%"%%'') and heredoc in various ways.

  1. Directly embedding variables ("$foo")
  2. Braces outside the variable ("{$foo}")
  3. Braces after the dollar sign ("${foo}")
  4. Variable variables ("${expr}", equivalent to `(string) ${expr}`)

Options 1 and 2 have their pros and cons. Options 3 and 4 are easily confused due to overlapping syntax, 3 is strictly less capable than 1 and 2, and 4 has completely different semantics ([[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.variable.php|variable variables]]) that are rarely useful in string interpolation.

This RFC proposes to deprecate options 3 and 4 in PHP 8.2 and remove them in PHP 9.0.  That leaves only two string interpolation options: direct (simple variable only) and powerful (the one that does the most now).

===== Status quo =====

Options 1, 2 and 3 roughly try to achieve the same thing, embedding simple variables or chains in a string.  They all support a different subset of features.

==== Simple variable interpolation ====

Options 1, 2, and 3 support embedding basic variables.

<code php>
$foo = 'foo';

var_dump("$foo");
var_dump("{$foo}");
var_dump("${foo}");
</code>

==== Array-offset interpolation ====

Options 1, 2, and 3 allow accessing an array offset. Unfortunately, the syntax is not consistent.

<code php>
$foo = ['bar' => 'bar'];

var_dump("$foo[bar]");
var_dump("{$foo['bar']}");
var_dump("${foo['bar']}");
</code>

It's worth noting that options 2 and 3 support arbitrary expressions between ''['' and '']'', whereas option 1 only supports simple strings with no spaces or other special characters.

==== Object property interpolation ====

Only syntax 1 and 2 allow accessing properties.

<code php>
$foo = (object) ['bar' => 'bar'];

var_dump("$foo->bar");
var_dump("{$foo->bar}");
</code>

==== Method call interpolation ====

Only syntax 2 allows calling methods.

<code php>
class Foo {
    public function bar() {
        return 'bar';
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();
var_dump("{$foo->bar()}");
</code>

==== Compound interpolation ====

Only syntax 2 allows chaining all of the above.

<code php>
class Bar {
    public function baz() {
        return 'baz';
    }
}

$foo = ['bar' => new Bar()];
var_dump("{$foo['bar']->baz()}");
</code>

==== Option 4 ====

PHP has a feature called [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.variable.php|Variable variables]]. It allows you to get a variable by name. The name can be a string stored in another variable.

<code php>
$foo = 'Hello world!';
$bar = 'foo';
var_dump(${$bar});
</code>

The same works within strings. This is the option 4 described above.

<code php>
$foo = 'world!';
$bar = 'foo';
var_dump("Hello ${$bar}");
</code>

As you might notice, this syntax clashes with option 3. If the term between the two braces is not compatible with option 3 PHP will interpret it as option 4 which has completely different semantics.

<code php>
const foo = 'bar';
$foo = 'foo';
$bar = 'bar';

var_dump("${foo}");
//> foo

var_dump("${(foo)}");
//> bar
</code>

The braces switch from option 3 to 4 because braces are not allowed in option 3. This means ''foo'' is no longer interpreted as a variable but as a constant, and option 4 will then try to find a local variable by the name of that constant. This is incredibly unintuitive. Even though I cannot imagine a scenario where variable variables in strings are useful it's worth noting that they can still be expressed with option 2 as ''"{${expr}}"'' with a more consistent syntax.

===== Conclusion =====

Option 1 offers a simple "base case" for the most common situation and is widely used.

Option 2 offers the most robust syntax currently supported, and is widely used.

Option 3 offers a subset of the functionality of option 1 and 2, and is less widely used.

Option 4 offers functionality that is rarely if ever useful, and easily confused with option 3.

For all of the reasons above this RFC proposes to deprecate option 3 and 4 in PHP 8.2 and remove them in PHP 9.

===== Migration path =====

The migration of option 3 to 2 is straight forward. Simply move the dollar sign.

<code php>
"${foo}" => "{$foo}"
"${foo[expr]}" => "{$foo[expr]}"
</code>

The migration of option 4 to 2 is also straight forward. The main challenge is differentiating between form 3 and 4 (which is a motivation of this RFC). In practice, 4 should be almost non-existent.

<code php>
"${foo->bar}" => "{${foo->bar}}"
</code>

==== Comparison to other languages ====

A number of other languages use ''%%${foo}%%'' style string interpolation, most notably bash and JavaScript (in template literals).  However, its behavior is different from that in PHP.  In PHP, that syntax means variable variables.  In JavaScript, it supports arbitrary expressions 2).  In its current form, options 3 and 4 are of limited use, and confusing for users from other nearby languages as they behaves quite differently.

====== Future scope ======

Options 1 and 2 are not perfect either. They only allow simple expressions on variables. A different RFC might propose to allow embedding arbitrary expressions into strings.

<code php>
var_dump("{$:func()}")
</code>

If we decide to do that it would make sense to remove the less useful options first to not further add to the confusion, that's what this RFC is trying to achieve.

===== Vote =====

Voting starts 2022-xx-x and ends 2022-xx-xx. 

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.
