====== PHP RFC: __toArray() ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-08-28
  * Author: Steven Wade, stevenwadejr@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to add a new magic method called <nowiki>__toArray()</nowiki> to allow a class to control how it is represented when converted to an array.

PHP contains many [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php|magic methods]] that give a class greater control over its interaction with the language. The methods [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/custom_object_serialization|__serialize() and __unserialize()]] give a class control over how it is serialized, <nowiki>__clone()</nowiki> allows control over how self copies are made, and <nowiki>__toString()</nowiki> allows a class to control how it is represented when converted to a string. Adding a <nowiki>__toArray()</nowiki> method gives developers the ability to transform a class to an array in similar fashion.

===== Proposal =====
Example:
<code php>

class Person
{
    protected $name;
    protected $email;
    
    public $foo = 'bar';

    public function __construct(string $name, string $email)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email  = $email;
    }

    public function __toArray()
    {
        return [
            'name' => $this->name,
            'email'  => $this->email,
        ];
    }
}

$person = new Person('John Doe', 'j.doe@example.com');
</code>

Example usage:

<code php>
print_r($person); // calls __toArray()

// Output
/*
Array
(
    [name] => John Doe
    [email] => j.doe@example.com
)
*/

$personArray = (array) $person; // casting triggers __toArray()
</code>

==== What this is ====
The example above shows the method <nowiki>__toArray()</nowiki> used in a type-casting context.  This proposal would have objects implementing the <nowiki>__toArray()</nowiki> magic method called within //any// array context including type hinting and return types.

Similar to PHP's current implementation of <nowiki>__toString()</nowiki>, a copy of the given object's value as an array is made upon conversion.

**Type Hinting**

<code php>
function foo(array $person) {
    var_dump($person);
}

// Output
/*
array(2) {
  ["name"]=>
  string(8) "John Doe"
  ["email"]=>
  string(17) "j.doe@example.com"
}
*/
</code>

**Return Type**

<code php>
function bar(Person $person): array {
    return $person;
}

var_dump(bar($person));

// Output
/*
array(2) {
  ["name"]=>
  string(8) "John Doe"
  ["email"]=>
  string(17) "j.doe@example.com"
}
*/
</code>

**array_*  and built-in functions**

The array operating functions listed on the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php|Array Functions]] would first convert an object implementing the <nowiki>__toArray()</nowiki> method before continuing operations.

<code php>
print_r(array_keys($person));

// Output
/*
Array
(
    [0] => first
    [1] => email
)
*/
</code>

==== What this is not ====
This proposal does not allow accessing and setting values as you would in a normal array, that functionality remains with classes implementing the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.arrayaccess.php|ArrayAccess]] interface.

Array functions that operate on an array by reference such as <nowiki>sort</nowiki> or <nowiki>shuffle</nowiki> will not work on an object implementing <nowiki>__toArray()</nowiki> under this proposal.

===== Concerns =====

A [[https://externals.io/message/105589#105594|concern raised in the initial RFC proposal discussion]] referred to the existing behavior of casting and exposing object state:

>As it currently stands, the array cast is the only operation capable of
exposing object state without triggering any kind of access guards: it is
very much required for anything that works with reflection and typed
properties, and possibly the only operation in PHP that operates on state
without some contraption intercepting its execution.

As a response to this concern, the new <nowiki>get_mangled_object_vars()</nowiki> function was added in [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/eecd8961d94c50cc6cdc94ec80df8c1ce4881a76|PHP 7.4]].

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Vote will require 2/3 majority

===== Patches and Tests =====
No patch exists yet. A [[https://github.com/sgolemon/php-src/tree/experimental.toarray|proof of concept]] for type casting was created by Sara Golemon, but no official patch has been created.  Will need help with this.
