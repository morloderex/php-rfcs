===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes a new operator, the "nullsafe" operator ''<nowiki>?-></nowiki>'', which allows safe chaining of method calls. This is useful to easily propagate errors forward to the end of a computation which should fail if any of its sub-computations should fail.

===== Proposal =====
A very common pattern is to have some a computation consisting of a series of method calls, any one of which can return null. If any of them do return null, the entire computation should fail. Right now, writing something like this in PHP requires a bunch of boilerplate checks after each call. For example:

<PHP>
function f($o) {
  $o2 = $o->mayFail1();
  if ($o2 === null) {
    return null;
  }

  $o3 = $o2->mayFail2();
  if ($o3 === null) {
    return null;
  }

  $o4 = $o3->mayFail3();
  if ($o4 === null) {
    return null;
  }

  return $o4->mayFail4();
}
</PHP>

This certainly works, but it's a lot of boilerplate for a fairly common pattern, and it's also a lot of explicit checks that the runtime must do. Instead, a new operator is added to the language: ''<nowiki>?-></nowiki>''. Calling ''$obj<nowiki>?-></nowiki>foo(..)'' behaves identically to ''$obj<nowiki>-></nowiki>foo(..)'' if ''$obj'' is not null. If ''$obj'' is null, then it returns null.

This means that calls using this new operator can be chained together. For example, the code above, rewritten with the new operator:

<PHP>
function f($o) {
  return $o?->mayFail1()?->mayFail2()?->mayFail3()?->mayFail4();
}
</PHP>

==== Short Circuit ====
If ''$obj'' is null, when ''$obj<nowiki>?-></nowiki>foo(..)'' executes, the arguments will still be evaluated. In other words, ''<nowiki>?-></nowiki>'' does **not** have short circuit semantics when evaluating arguments.

This is done because it parallels what the ''<nowiki>-></nowiki>'' operator does. The arguments are evaluated whether or not the function being called actually consumes them.  Furthermore, ''<nowiki>?-></nowiki>'' is effectively an error suppression/propagation mechanism. This means that its usage should not affect the way arguments are evaluated; doing anything else would be very confusing for the programmer.

It's worth noting that this point has deep implications for the implementation, which must at least begin to actually execute the call opcode, so that arguments can be evaluated. It cannot simply be implemented as a syntactic transform into a ternary or similar!

==== Implications ====
For the purpose of clarity, some implications of the above definition; all of these stem from consistency between ''<nowiki>-></nowiki>'' and ''<nowiki>?-></nowiki>'', and trying to avoid strange behavioral changes when the left-hand side is or is not null.

  * If ''$obj'' is an object whose class does **not** define a method "foo", then ''$obj<nowiki>?-></nowiki>foo(..)'' will still raise a fatal error.
  *  If ''$obj'' is anything other than null or object, then ''$obj<nowiki>?-></nowiki>foo(..)'' will still raise a fatal error.

==== Prior Art ====
  * C#, CoffeeScript, and Groovy all have a "safe navigation operator" which was the original inspiration for this feature.
  * Haskell has the "maybe monad", which syntactically looks quite different but morally provides a similar mechanism to propagate any failure in a computation forward to the end of the computation.
  * Hack has already implemented a proposal identical to this one.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Due to an implementation detail, this decreases the maximum number of arguments a function can be called with from ''2^32'' to ''2^31'', and adds an error when that limit is reached. (The engine would previously just wrap around, to potentially disastrous consequences.)

This is just a technicality... all of my attempts to actually hit that limit put my machine into swapdeath long before I got close :-P

See also "RFC Impact To Existing Extensions" below.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP7.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Existing Extensions ====
Extensions have access to an opline's ''extended_value'', and the current implementation re-uses a single bit at the top of it for a new purpose. This is a backwards compatibility break for extensions which read the ''extended_value'' out of the "begin fcall" opcode -- though arguably extensions like RunKit which do this probably shouldn't be anyways ;)

If this impact is deemed too much, there are certainly other implementation options, which I think are less attractive. We could add a new ''OP_DATA'' opcode after the begin fcall, but that seems like dramatic overkill for storing a single bit.

==== New Constants ====
Nothing accessible from outside the internals of the engine.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This RFC does not change any existing PHP behavior, including the ''<nowiki>-></nowiki>'' operator, the ''??'' operator, the ''@'' operator, or other error suppression mechanisms.

===== Future Scope =====
The ''<nowiki>?-></nowiki>'' operator is not valid to use for a member access, and will generate an ''E_COMPILE_ERROR'' if this is attempted. Defining such functionality is left to a further RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This is pretty clearly a core language change and so requires 2/3. The vote will be a straight yes/no vote on accepting the new operator.

===== Patches and Tests =====
  * php-src: I have a branch at https://github.com/jwatzman/php-src/compare/nullsafe-prototype?expand=1 with a working implementation. Includes tests copied from HHVM's implementation.
  * PHP spec: not yet, but will do if the RFC is accepted.
  * PHP docs: import Hack's documentation when they add it: https://github.com/hhvm/hack-hhvm-docs/issues/360 (that task will get completed well before this RFC is voted on, accepted, merged, etc)

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
HHVM's implementation for the Hack language is at https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/8fd5a78b02d2d62538e77fcbc927df759c1722f9.

===== Rejected Features =====
