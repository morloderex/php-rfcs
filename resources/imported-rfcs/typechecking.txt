===== Request for Comments: Parameter type specification =====

=== History ===
PHP is a [[http://php.net/types|dynamically typed language]], that does [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php|automatic type juggling]] where ever possible. With PHP 5 a new feature called [[http://ch2.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php|"type hinting"]] was introduced for arrays and objects. However the name "hint" is a bit misnamed, since triggers an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR. While a fatal error can be prevented with an error handler, its not really nicely doable, since this needs to happen in a global error handler, far away in terms of code from the original context. It also comes with quite an overhead.
