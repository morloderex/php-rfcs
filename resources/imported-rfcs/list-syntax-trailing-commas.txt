====== PHP RFC: Trailing Commas In List Syntax ======

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes allowing trailing commas for all list syntax.

Per the feedback on the internals list, this RFC broadens the scope of the [[rfc:revisit-trailing-comma-function-args|original RFC to allow trailing commas in function arguments]] to all list syntax.

Arrays in PHP have long since supported trailing commas.

=== Trailing array commas ===
<code php>
$foo = [
    'foo',
    'bar',
];
</code>

This makes for clean diffs and easy appending of new values in user-land.

Unfortunately, the other lists do not share the same luxury.

=== Raises a parse error ===
<code php>
<?php
use Foo\Bar\{
    Foo,
    Bar,
    Baz,
};
</code>

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes allowing trailing commas in all list syntax in order to:

  - Offer a consistent API and match the existing array functionality.
  - Make it easy to append new elements to a list in user-land.
  - Have cleaner diffs (so only one line shows up as being modified when appending elements instead of two).
  - It makes code reviews a tiny bit faster and for really large codebases, that time adds up. ([[https://people.php.net/user.php?username=pollita|Sara Golemon]] explained [[https://www.mail-archive.com/internals@lists.php.net/msg81138.html|why HHVM added the trailing comma syntax]].)

The following lists would allow trailing commas:

  - Grouped namepaces
  - Function/method arguments (declarations & calls)
  - Interface implementations on a class
  - Trait implementations on a class
  - Class member lists
  - Inheriting variables from the parent scope in anonymous functions

[[https://people.php.net/user.php?username=marcio|Marcio Almada]] posted a gist with [[https://gist.github.com/marcioAlmada/75f8f1d47da5dcac2e57|examples of trailing commas]] for the various lists (shown below):

=== Trailing commas for all lists ===
<code php>
<?php
// Grouped namepaces
use Foo\Bar\{ Foo, Bar, Baz, };

// Arrays (already possible)
$array = [1, 2, 3,];

// Function/method arguments (call)
fooCall($arg1, $arg2, $arg3,);

class Foo implements
    // Interface implementations on a class
    FooInterface,
    BarInterface,
    BazInterface,
{
    // Trait implementations on a class
    use
        FooTrait,
        BarTrait,
        BazTrait,
    ;
    
    // Class member lists
    const
        A = 1010,
        B = 1021,
        C = 1032,
        D = 1043,
    ;
    protected
        $a = 'foo',
        $b = 'bar',
        $c = 'baz',
    ;
    private
        $blah,
    ;
    
    // Function/method arguments (declaration)
    function something(FooBarBazInterface $in, FooBarBazInterface $out,) : bool
    {
    }
}

// Inheriting variables from the parent scope in anonymous functions
$foo = function ($bar) use (
    $a,
    $b,
    $c,
) {
	// . . . 
};
</code>

===== Discussion Points =====

There are a number of questions that have already been discussed on the internals list.

==== How will it work with variadics? ====

PHP allows for multiple splats in one call so trailing commas would work the same way.

<code php>
foo(
    ...$args,
    ...$moreArgs,
    ...$evenMoreArgs,
);
</code>

==== Why allocate resources to make this happen ====

The actual implementation for adding tailing commas to function arguments/calls is [[https://github.com/sgolemon/php-src/compare/master...trailing-comma#diff-7eff82c2c5b45db512a9dc49fb990bb8L517|two lines]]. Implementing the functionality to all lists would not require many more changes to the php-src codebase.

==== You could just use leading commas ====

<code php>
function foo(
   $bar
  ,$baz
  ,$boo
) { ... }
</code>

  - Leading commas would break away from PSRs
  - Parsing leading commas cause cognitive overhead whereas standard practice calls for trailing commas

==== The arguments for & against are weak ====

**TL;DR:**

  * **For it:** It's handy. (And the reasons detailed above).
  * **Against:** It's ugly. There are only minor gains.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This change would have no breaking changes.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====

PHP 7.1

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Each trailing comma list syntax would get its own vote and would require a 2/3 majority to pass.

  - Function/method arguments (declarations & calls)
  - Grouped namepaces
  - Interface implementations on a class
  - Trait implementations on a class
  - Class member lists
  - Inheriting variables from the parent scope in anonymous functions
