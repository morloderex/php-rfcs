===== Patches and Tests =====

  * Removal of ext/ereg: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/816
  * Removal of everything else not marked with ''[TODO]'': https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/815

===== Vote =====

Three votes are suggested:

  * Removal of ext/ereg, requiring simple majority.
  * Removal of ext/mysql, requiring simple majority.
  * Removal of everything else, requiring 2/3 majority, as it includes language features.

The last vote may be split further in case some points are heavily contested.
