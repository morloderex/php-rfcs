===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to remove functionality which has been deprecated during the 5.x cycle.

The following extensions are deprecated:

  * ext/ereg (since PHP 5.3; use ext/pcre instead)
  * ext/mysql (since PHP 5.5; use ext/mysqli or ext/pdo_mysql instead) [TODO]

The following language features are deprecated:

  * Assignment of ''new'' by reference (since PHP 5.3; use normal assignment instead)
  * Scoped calls of non-static methods from incompatible ''$this'' context (since PHP 5.6)

The following functions are deprecated:

  * ''dl'' on fpm-fcgi (since PHP 5.3)
  * ''set_magic_quotes_runtime'' and ''magic_quotes_runtime'' (since PHP 5.4)
  * ''set_socket_blocking'' (since PHP 5.4; use ''stream_set_blocking'' instead)
  * ''mcrypt_generic_end'' (since PHP 5.4; use ''mcrypt_generic_deinit'' instead)
  * ''mcrypt_ecb'', ''mcrypt_cbc'', ''mcrypt_cfb'' and ''mcrypt_ofb'' (since PHP 5.5, but documented as deprecated earlier; use ''mcrypt_encrypt'' and ''mcrypt_decrypt'' instead)
  * ''datefmt_set_timezone_id'' and ''IntlDateFormatter::setTimeZoneID'' (since PHP 5.5; use ''datefmt_set_timezone'' or ''IntlDateFormatter::setTimeZone'' instead) [TODO]

The following ini options are deprecated:

  * ''xsl.security_prefs'' (since PHP 5.4; use ''XsltProcessor::setSecurityPrefs'' instead)
  * ''iconv.input_encoding'', ''iconv.output_encoding'', ''iconv.internal_encoding'', ''mbstring.http_input'', ''mbstring.http_output'' and ''mbstring.internal_encoding'' (since PHP 5.6; use ''php.input_encoding'', ''php.internal_encoding'' and ''php.output_encoding'' instead) [TODO]

The following miscellaneous functionality is deprecated:

  * ''#'' style comments in ini files (since PHP 5.3; use '';'' style comments instead)
  * String category names in ''setlocale()'' (since PHP 5.3; use ''LC_*'' constants instead)
  * The ''$is_dst'' parameter of the ''mktime()'' and ''gmmktime()'' functions (since PHP 5.3)
  * Unsafe curl file uploads (since PHP 5.5; use ''CurlFile'' instead)
  * ''preg_replace()'' eval modifier (since PHP 5.5; use ''preg_replace_callback'' instead)
  * ''PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_NATIVE_PREPARED_STATEMENT'' driver option (since PHP 5.6; use ''PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES'' instead) [TODO]
  * ''CN_match'' and ''SNI_server_name'' stream context option (since PHP 5.6; use ''peer_name'' instead) [TODO]

===== Patches and Tests =====

Note: Patches are very outdated.

  * Removal of ext/ereg: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/816
  * Removal of everything else not marked with ''[TODO]'': https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/815

===== Votes =====

==== ext/ereg ====

The ereg extension has been deprecated since PHP 5.3. The PCRE extension should be used instead. PCRE provides better Unicode support and many more features in general. The ereg extension is effectively unmaintained currently.

If ext/ereg is removed as a bundled extension, it can still be made available as a PECL extension.

Vote: Requires simple majority.

==== ext/mysql ====

The mysql extension has been deprecated since PHP 5.5. The mysqli or PDO extension should be used instead. The deprecation has been decided in [[rfc/mysql_deprecation]], where a discussion of the reasons behind this decision can be found.

If ext/mysql is removed as a bundled extension, it can still be made available as a PECL extension.

Vote: Requires simple majority.

==== Assignment of ''new'' by reference ====

Since PHP 5.3 assignment of ''new'' expressions by references is deprecated. It can be replaced with a normal assignment ((reference-breaking notwithstanding)):

<code php>
// Instead of
$obj =& new ClassName;
// Write
$obj = new ClassName;
</code>

Assigning the return value by reference is no longer necessary since PHP 5.0.

Vote: Requires 2/3 majority.

==== Scoped calls of non-static methods from incompatible ''$this'' context ====

Since PHP 5.5 scoped calls of non-static methods from incompatible ''$this'' contexts are deprecated, while they already generated an ''E_STRICT'' level error previously. The deprecation has been decided in [[rfc/incompat_ctx]], where examples of this functionality can be found.

The RFC already specified that the functionality will be removed in the next version after deprecation, as such this vote may dropped.

Vote: Requires 2/3 majority.

==== ''#'' style comments in ini files ====

The standard ini file format uses '';'' to denote comments. However PHP [[http://markmail.org/message/xsvd3eyrijlpnfl2|accidentially (?)]] also supported comments starting with ''#'' in some circumstances. When this was discovered in PHP 5.3, they were deprecated.

Vote: Simple majority.

==== Deprecated functions ====

The following functions are deprecated:

  * ''dl'' on fpm-fcgi (since PHP 5.3)
  * ''set_magic_quotes_runtime'' and ''magic_quotes_runtime'' (since PHP 5.4)
  * ''set_socket_blocking'' (since PHP 5.4; use ''stream_set_blocking'' instead)
  * ''mcrypt_generic_end'' (since PHP 5.4; use ''mcrypt_generic_deinit'' instead)
  * ''mcrypt_ecb'', ''mcrypt_cbc'', ''mcrypt_cfb'' and ''mcrypt_ofb'' (since PHP 5.5, but documented as deprecated earlier; use ''mcrypt_encrypt'' and ''mcrypt_decrypt'' instead)
  * ''datefmt_set_timezone_id'' and ''IntlDateFormatter::setTimeZoneID'' (since PHP 5.5; use ''datefmt_set_timezone'' or ''IntlDateFormatter::setTimeZone'' instead)

Using the ''dl'' function in SAPIs that run more than one request has stability concerns. As such it has already been removed from most multi-request SAPIs, fpm-fcgi is the last one left.

''set_magic_quotes_runtime'' and ''magic_quotes_runtime'' have been deprecated, but left as compatibility stubs for the magic quotes functionality that has been dropped in PHP 5.4. They don't do anything anymore but throw errors.

The remaining functions are just legacy aliases or quasi-aliases.

Vote: Requires simple majority.

==== Miscellaneous ====

The following miscellaneous functionality is deprecated:

  * ''xsl.security_prefs'' (since PHP 5.4; use ''XsltProcessor::setSecurityPrefs'' instead)
  * ''iconv.input_encoding'', ''iconv.output_encoding'', ''iconv.internal_encoding'', ''mbstring.http_input'', ''mbstring.http_output'' and ''mbstring.internal_encoding'' (since PHP 5.6; use ''php.input_encoding'', ''php.internal_encoding'' and ''php.output_encoding'' instead; see also [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/default_encoding]])
  * String category names in ''setlocale()'' (since PHP 5.3; use ''LC_*'' constants instead)
  * The ''$is_dst'' parameter of the ''mktime()'' and ''gmmktime()'' functions (since PHP 5.3)
  * Unsafe curl file uploads (since PHP 5.5; use ''CurlFile'' instead; see also [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl-file-upload]])
  * ''preg_replace()'' eval modifier (since PHP 5.5; use ''preg_replace_callback'' instead; see also [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_preg_replace_eval_modifier]])
  * ''PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_NATIVE_PREPARED_STATEMENT'' driver option (since PHP 5.6; use ''PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES'' instead)
  * ''CN_match'' and ''SNI_server_name'' stream context option (since PHP 5.6; use ''peer_name'' instead. Or don't specify it at all, it's automatically detected since PHP 5.6)

Vote: Requires simple majority
