===== Introduction =====

The elevator pitch for the RFC.

===== Proposal =====

Secure setting should be the default and user should selectively use weaker setting.

**use_strict_mode=on** disallow user supplied session ID and improve session ID security. Most applications work with this option.

**cookie_httponly=on** disallow use of session ID cookie from JavaScript. It reduces risk of stolen session ID via JavaScript injections. Most applications work with this option.

**hash_function=1** SHA1 has larger bits than MD5. (192 bits vs 128 bits) More difficult to guess. Most application work with SHA1 also. php.ini-development/production hash_char_bit is 5 already. Make compiled default to 5 also.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

PHP 5.6
