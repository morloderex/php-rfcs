====== PHP RFC: unset(): return bool if the variable has existed ======
  * Version: 0.53
  * Date: 2013-03-06 
  * Author: Bob Weinand, bobwei9@hotmail.com
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/unset_bool
  * Implementation: https://github.com/bwoebi/php-src/commit/787d71eed0c5e0140048b8fbacf799029b322661 (tests may follow later)

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to make unset return something meaningful. People also shouldn't have to wonder why they can't use unset if it isn't as a standalone expression.

This removes also an inconsistency: the function's return value is //void//, states the docs. It is until now the only function (language construct, function-like) (apart from echo, which already has an alternative: print) which has no return value.

===== Proposal =====

Change unset()'s behaviour to:
  * return true if deletion was successful
  * return false if deletion failed

The feature could be useful in if's like:
<code php>
public function deleteKey ($key) {
	if (unset($this->array[$key])) {
		// do some cleanup
	}
}
</code>

This is the way we do it today:
<code php>
public function deleteKey ($key) {
	if (isset($this->array[$key])) {
		unset($this->array[$key]);
		// do some cleanup
	}
}
</code>
But even now we can't be sure if the variable was unset, because the _////_unset() magic method may not have deleted it. With the patch _////_unset() can return a value (which is internally casted to bool) and inform the caller of unset() if the deletion was successful.

The main advantage is that you can do constructs like this: https://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blob;f=Zend/zend_object_handlers.c#l818 I am just asking myself: when you use it in the Engine, why don't you offer the possibility to PHP?

===== Execution example =====

<code php>
$var = 1;
var_dump(unset($var)); // bool(true)
var_dump(unset($var)); // bool(false)

$var = 1;
var_dump(unset($var, $undefined)); // evaluates to unset($var) && unset($undefined) == bool(false) (like isset() works)

$dim[1] = "set";
var_dump(unset($dim[2])); // bool(false)
var_dump(unset($dim[1])); // bool(true)

class object {
	private $property;

	public function __unset($var) {
		if ($var == "prima")
			return false;
		if ($var == "secunda")
			return unset($this->property);
		if ($var == "tertia")
			return "some garbage";
	}
}
$class = new object;
$class->prop = 0;
var_dump(unset($class->prop)); // bool(true)
var_dump(unset($class->prima)); // bool(false)
var_dump(unset($class->secunda)); // bool(true)
var_dump(unset($class->tertia)); // bool(true)
var_dump(unset($class->quarta)); // bool(false) (a function execution without return returns NULL, which is, casted to boolean, false)
</code>

===== Implementation Details ===

Every deleting function called by the VM_HANDLERs ZEND_UNSET_* now return //int//: SUCCESS or FAILURE.
All the functions which didn't were previously //void// functions, so only adding a return value shouldn't affect any existing code (only exception: see one section below).

The zend_do_unset function was adapted to zend_do_isset_or_is_empty in behaviour. As it's mostly reusing existing code, it shouldn't be error-prone.

The rest was adding loads of "result = SUCCESS/FAILURE;" into the various void functions.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

There may break some extensions which have their own unset_property and/or unset_dimension class-handler.
This can easily be fixed by changing the return value from //void// to //int// and returning SUCCESS (or FAILURE).

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Should be implemented in the next 5.x (e.g. 5.5 if it's delayed due to ZO+ or 5.6).

===== Microbenchmark =====

<code>
time ./sapi/cli/php -r 'while($i++ < 1e7) { $a = true; unset($a); }'

Unpatched: average of 5x executed:
real	0m4.935s
user	0m4.925s
sys	0m0.008s

Patched: average of 5x executed:
real	0m4.945s
user	0m4.938s
sys	0m0.005s
</code>
This is an increase of 0.15%. This is 1 nanosecond per execution more than previously.
