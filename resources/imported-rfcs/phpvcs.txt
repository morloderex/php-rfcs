==== Purpose ====

The idea is to get PHP away from CVS, which while a venerable and respected version control system, is just too old to serve our needs any longer. Several different newer systems have been proposed, notably [[http://subversion.tigris.org/|Subversion]] and [[http://git.or.cz/|Git]].

=== Subversion ===
Some comments on SVN, partially from [[http://wiki.pooteeweet.org/PHPSVN/]] and edited for clarity:

Reasons for SVN:
  - Client-side diffs (faster, offline, less server strain)
  - Serving via apache2 makes all sorts of things possible (better karma management)
  - SVN correctly handles binary types and all newline styles
  - Directories, renames, etc. are all versioned.
  - Ability to use SVK (star merges, and more)
  - Ability to do external includes (e.g. pear stuff into pecl/pearweb)

Reasons against SVN:
  - <del>Larger checkout size</del> - An inevitability anyway as the code base grows
  - <del>SVN tools not available in all distros by default</del> - This is no longer true in modern systems, and it is easily installed on those which don't come with it
  - $Id$ equivalent does not generate consequtive numbering per file
  - <del>Developers will need to learn to do some things differently</del> - SVN's interface is very similar to CVS's.
  - <del>is svn as flexible with encoding as CVS?</del> - SVN is in fact considerably moreso
  - <del>SVN doesn't have real tags</del>

On the subject of SVN tags, php [AT] adamashley [DOT] name says:
>> SVN doesn't have real tags
> thank god. how many times have you created a tag and need to come back and turn it into a branch? the under lying system should place limitations upon how you use it, those limitations should only be agreed upon and implemented by the people using the system.
