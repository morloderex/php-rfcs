To start, here's a blockquote from [[http://wiki.pooteeweet.org/PHPSVN/]]:

Reasons for SVN:
  - diffs (on the client means faster, offline and less strain on server)
  - tagging/branching
  - serving via apache2 makes all sorts of things possible (better karma management)
  - SVN manipulates the filetypes and does not require any special instructions.
  - Directories, renames, etc. are all versioned.
  - Ability to use SVK (star merges, and more)
  - Ability to do external includes (e.g. pear stuff into pecl/pearweb)

Reasons against SVN:
  - larger checkout size
  - svn tools not available in all distros by default
  - $ID:$ equivalent does not generate consequtive numbering per file
  - developers will need to learn to do some things differently
  - is svn as flexible with encoding as CVS?
  - svn doesn't have real tags
