===== Introduction =====

PHP 5 introduced the concept of autoloading classes.

However, many different projects adopted their own approach for class loader. 
In the mid of 2009, several lead developers started an initiative called PHP Standards Group (aka. Framework Interoperability Group), which is mainly focused on interoperability between different Open Source projects.

After an extensive discussions, group came with the primary interoperability between them, which is formally named as PHP Standards Recommendation #0 (or PSR-0).

PSR-0 focus on a flexible autoloader that could be used or shared between projects, structuring and organizing Object Oriented code. So any project that decides to be PSR-0 compliant just need to follow the defines rules defined in the next topic.
===== Proposal and Patch =====

The proposal and PHP implementation is already available anywhere through: [[http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal]]
