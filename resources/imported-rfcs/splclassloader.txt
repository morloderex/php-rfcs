===== Introduction =====

PHP 5 introduced the concept of autoloading classes.
However, many different projects adopted their own approach for class loader. In the mid of 2009, several lead developers started an initiative called PHP Standards Group, which is mainly focused on interoperability between Open Source projects.
After a couple of months of discussions, this group came with what they called as PSR-0 or PHP Standards Recommendation #0.
The intention of this document is to deliver a flexible autoloader that could be used by all projects, providing a more organized way to develop any application.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

The proposal and PHP implementation is already available anywhere through: [[http://tr.im/psr_0]]
Ideally, PSR-0 supports both PEAR style directory organization or Namespace style directory organization.

A usable C extension is already built, waiting for some feedback from PHP core if it should be merged or not.
The C extension is available at: [[http://github.com/metagoto/splclassloader]]
