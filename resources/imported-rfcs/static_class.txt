====== PHP RFC: Static class ======
  * Version: 1.1
  * Date: 2024-06-23
  * Author: Paul Morris, bilge@scriptfusion.com
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/static_class

===== Introduction =====

A static class is a class whose members (properties and methods) are all static. Implicit static classes can be created today, by simply only including static members. However, explicitly marking a class as static has several advantages:

  * Clear expression of developer intent.
  * Language-level compile-time checks to verify no instance members are included anywhere in the inheritance chain.
  * Language-level runtime checks to verify the object is never instantiated (using ''new'').

Of these advantages, the first can be somewhat mitigated with a [[https://github.com/ScriptFUSION/StaticClass/blob/master/src/StaticClass.php|userland trait]], but as such traits are non-standard, there is no consistent way to identify them between projects. The language-level checks cannot be so easily emulated, and are better suited for inclusion within PHP.

===== Proposal =====

A //static class// is so marked with the existing ''static'' keyword, adjacent to the class declaration.

<code php>
static class Foo {}
</code>

We introduce the ''static'' keyword at the class level to preclude the need to create a private constructor. That is, ''function %%__%%construct()'' is a compile-time error in a static class. Furthermore, instantiating a static class with ''new'' is a runtime error.

Whilst the goals of this RFC so expressed are fairly straightforward, we acknowledge there are many finer points to consider. In particular:

  - Should a static class imply ''final'' (as in C#)?
  - Should a static class prohibit inheritance (as in C#)?
  - Should a static class permit state?
  - Should traits be permitted in a static class?
  - Which magic methods should be supported?

To answer these questions, we consider the principal reason to mark a class static is to move from an implicit declaration to the explicit. Ergo, any decision precluding the developer from doing so is invalid. Thus we derive the following razor:

>We cannot remove features from a static class that would otherwise be present in a standard class.

Following this razor we arrive at the following design.

  - A static class may be marked ''final'', but in the absence of such a mark, may still be extended.
  - A static class may extend other (static) classes, whether or not so marked, provided they contain no instance members.
  - A static class may have static properties.
  - A static class may use traits.
  - All static magic methods must be supported, i.e. just ''%%__%%callStatic()''.

==== Static keyword for class members ====

One question our razor cannot answer is whether static member declarations still require the ''static'' keyword in a static class. Marking a class ''readonly'' makes marking properties with the same //optional//, thus one might argue ''static'' should follow suit. However, I opine it should not. Unlike ''readonly'', which typically applies to properties declared near the head of the class (by convention) where the same mark is also applied, static members appear throughout the full length of the class body. That is, it should be apparent when jumping anywhere into a static class that its members are static, without having to check the class declaration.

There is also third position one might take, to treat static as //forbidden// for members of a static class. This would probably be an unpopular option because it requires changing every member declaration to migrate existing classes, rather than just changing the class definition. Nevertheless, it is an option.

Choosing whether ''static'' should be //required//, //optional// or //forbidden// for members of a static class is still open for debate, and if it cannot be clearly settled on the mailing list, it may be posed as an additional voting option for this RFC (separately from the static class feature itself).

==== Anonymous classes ====

Anonymous classes are always instantiated and thus at odds with the concept of a static class. That is, the notion of an //anonymous static class// is inherently invalid and not supported.

===== Open questions =====

  - Can static classes be forbidden as type hints? If so, we should implement this.
  - Should static classes only permit extending //explicitly marked// static classes?

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None known.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.4

===== Future Scope =====

This feature is expected to be complete by itself.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * A simple yes/no vote to include this feature.
  * A choice between //required//, //optional// or //forbidden// to include ''static'' on member declarations within a static class (TBC).

===== Patches and Tests =====

The patch and tests will be created by myself and/or Lanre. A draft PR by Lanre is currently available at https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14583.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
