====== PHP RFC: Static class ======
  * Version: 1.4
  * Date: 2024-06-23
  * Author: Paul Morris <bilge@scriptfusion.com>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Target Version: PHP 8.4
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14861
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/static_class

===== Introduction =====

A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated, and whose members (properties and methods) are all static. Implicit static classes can be created today, by simply only including static members. However, explicitly marking a class as static has several advantages:

  * Clear expression of developer intent.
  * Language-level compile-time checks to verify no instance members are included anywhere in the inheritance chain.
  * Language-level runtime checks to verify the class is never instantiated by any mechanism.

Of these advantages, the first can be somewhat mitigated with a [[https://github.com/ScriptFUSION/StaticClass/blob/master/src/StaticClass.php|userland trait]], but as such traits are non-standard, there is no consistent way to identify them between projects. Moreover, the language-level checks cannot be so easily satisfied, thus are better suited for inclusion in PHP.

===== Proposal =====

A //static class// is so marked with the existing ''static'' keyword, adjacent to the class declaration.

<code php>
static class Foo {}
</code>

We introduce the ''static'' keyword at the class level to preclude the need to create a private constructor. That is, ''function %%__%%construct()'' is a compile-time error in a static class. Furthermore, attempting to instantiate a static by any means, whether with the ''new'' keyword, ''ReflectionClass::newInstance*'' methods or ''unserialize()'' hacks, is strictly forbidden and will result in a runtime error.

Whilst the goals of this RFC so expressed are fairly straightforward, we acknowledge there are many finer points to consider. In particular:

  - Should a static class imply ''final'' (as in C#)?
  - Should a static class prohibit inheritance (as in C#)?
  - Should a static class permit state?
  - Should traits be permitted in a static class?
  - Can a static class be marked abstract?
  - Which magic methods should be supported?

To answer these questions, we consider the principal reason to mark a class static is to move from an implicit declaration to the explicit. Ergo, any decision precluding the developer from doing so is invalid, since it coerces them to avoid explicit static, defeating its purpose. Thus we derive the following razor:

>We cannot remove features from a static class that would otherwise be present in a standard class.

Following this razor we arrive at the following design.

  - A static class may be marked ''final'', but in the absence of such a mark, may still be extended.
  - A static class may extend other static classes, provided the parents are also marked ''static''.
  - A static class may have static properties.
  - A static class may use traits, provided they introduce no instance members.
  - A static class may be marked abstract, since abstract static functions already exist in PHP.
  - All static magic methods must be supported, i.e. just ''%%__%%callStatic()''.

==== Static keyword for class members ====

One question our razor cannot answer is whether static member declarations still require the ''static'' keyword in a static class.

Marking a class ''readonly'' makes marking properties with the same //optional//, thus one might argue ''static'' should follow suit. However, I opine it should not. Unlike ''readonly'', which typically applies to properties declared near the head of the class (by convention) where the same modifier is also applied, static members appear throughout the full length of the class body. That is, it should be apparent when jumping anywhere into a static class that its members are static, without having to check the class declaration. Therefore this RFC still requires the ''static'' modifier for all members regardless of whether the class is also marked ''static'', to prevent them appearing as instance members. Aside, this is commensurate with the C# approach.

==== Mutually exclusive modifiers ====

When ''static'' is applied to a class, the following other class-level modifiers become invalid and will raise compile-time errors.

  * ''readonly'' — Read-only properties are only supported for instance properties, but instance properties are forbidden by ''static''.

==== Inheritance =====

  * A static class only permits extending a parent class that is also marked ''static''.
  * A non-static class cannot extend a static class.
  * A static class can inherit from an abstract class, provided it is also marked ''static''.

==== Anonymous classes ====

Anonymous classes are always instantiated and thus at odds with the concept of a static class. That is, the notion of an //anonymous static class// is inherently invalid and not supported.

==== Dynamic properties ====

Undeclared object properties can be added //dynamically// to object instances, but since static classes cannot be instantiated, there is nothing to attach such properties to. Static properties must always be declared explicitly.

==== Reflection extensions ====

A new ''ReflectionClass::isStatic'' method should be added, returning ''true'' when the class is so marked, otherwise ''false''.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None known.

===== Future Scope =====

  - As noted in [[readonly_properties_v2#restrictions|Readonly properties 2.0]], read-only static properties are not supported due to a technical limitation. If that limitation should ever be lifted, we could revisit lifting the restriction on mutual exclusivity with the ''readonly'' modifier.
  - Static interfaces may be introduced later if there is such a demand.
  - Static traits may be introduced later if there is such a demand.

This author has no intention to pursue any of these possible extensions at this time.

===== Vote =====

As per the [[RFC/voting#required_majority|voting RFC]] a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started on 2024-07-XX and will end on 2024-XX-XX.

===== Discussion =====

Though this is a fairly straightforward RFC, it is not without its detractors. Some view static classes, even without any state, as an anti-pattern; just a namespace cheat that should instead be presented as namespaced functions (sans-class wrapper). That goes double for static classes including state, where static properties can be viewed as equivalent to global state, which is widely regarded as an anti-pattern. However, this RFC is //not// encouraging any particular patterns. On the contrary, we are merely returning a small but nevertheless useful tool to the developer's toolkit that could have been available since classes were introduced. In this humble author's opinion, static classes //should// just be a collection of pure functions, but as defined by our opening razor, we will //not// remove features from a static class that exist in a non-static class because we do not have the liberty of designing a new language, we're designing PHP, with all the weight of its past carried forward. Anyone wishing to remove features from PHP can submit a separate RFC, or perhaps more practically, just add a check to their favourite code style tool.

Some regard namespaced functions as the correct way to implement static classes. That is, a file of floating functions under a namespace, as in [[https://github.com/amphp/amp/blob/138801fb68cfc9c329da8a7b39d01ce7291ee4b0/src/functions.php|Amp]]. This author requested comments that would speak to any technical or philosophical reason for why this would be strictly better than a static class, but the only technical argument fielded was that classes can be autoloaded and functions cannot. Curiously, this fact only speaks //in favour// of static classes. One might argue this difference is negligible thanks to Composer; files of functions can be loaded by Composer, but in this case the file is //always// loaded, not //auto//loaded. Still, this could be splitting hairs since opcache presumably trivializes this difference. Interestingly, the current Amp maintainers commented that namespaced functions were something they inherited, and if they had to do it all over again, would probably elect for static classes. The conclusion seems to be that those preferring one style over the other do so purely out of personal preference and not because one is technically nor even philosophically superior.

===== In the wild =====
Today, implicit static classes are all around us, in proprietary projects and some of the largest open source projects in the world, often called //utils// or //helpers// All of these classes would benefit from being explicitly marked static. To name a few:

  * PHPUnit
    * Almost everything under [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/tree/10.5/src/Util|Util]] including:
      * [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Util/Color.php|Color]]
      * [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Util/Exporter.php|Exporter]]
      * [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Util/Filesystem.php|Filesystem]]
      * [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Util/GlobalState.php|GlobalState]]
      * [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Util/Json.php|Json]]
      * [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Util/Reflection.php|Reflection]]
    * Interestingly, [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/10.5/src/Framework/Assert.php|Assert]] would //not// be a static class because, despite being filled entirely with static methods, is intended to be extended by test class instances. In a (future) static class world, the absence of the ''static'' modifier would more clearly communicate this intent.
  * Symfony
    * [[https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/1a16ebc32598faada074e0af12a6a698d2964a5e/src/Symfony/Component/Uid/BinaryUtil.php#L47|BinaryUtil]]
    * [[https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/1a16ebc32598faada074e0af12a6a698d2964a5e/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Util/FormUtil.php#L33|FormUtil]]
    * Almost everything under [[https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/1a16ebc32598faada074e0af12a6a698d2964a5e/src/Symfony/Component/VarDumper/Caster|VarDumper/Caster]]
  * Laravel – half this framework appears to be static, though fewer classes qualify as pure static, including:
    * Several classes under [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/tree/f5f9383af919ef74b00eacb23b4a88fcf390743c/src/Illuminate/Support|Support]] including:
      * [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/f5f9383af919ef74b00eacb23b4a88fcf390743c/src/Illuminate/Support/Env.php|Env]]
      * [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/f5f9383af919ef74b00eacb23b4a88fcf390743c/src/Illuminate/Support/Pluralizer.php|Pluralizer]]
      * [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/f5f9383af919ef74b00eacb23b4a88fcf390743c/src/Illuminate/Support/Reflector.php|Reflector]]
    * Literally everything under [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/tree/11.x/src/Illuminate/Support/Facades|Facades]]

===== Rejected Features =====

==== Forbidding static class type declarations ====

It should be regarded as an error to use a static class as a type declaration, since they cannot be instantiated and thus the requirement can never be fulfilled by a matching instance. However, it is not technically possible to forbid such declarations within PHP itself because type checking is done when an instance is passed at runtime (and we can never have such an instance). The engine does not support type checking at compile time for function/method signatures. Such a check would be a good candidate for third party static analysers instead.
