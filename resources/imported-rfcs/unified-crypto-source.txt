====== PHP RFC: Unify crypt source INI settings ======

===== Introduction =====

Crypt source such as /dev/urandom is mandatory for secure programs. None the less, PHP does not have way to specify crypt source as a core. This RFC proposes 2 new INIs for it.

===== Proposal =====

Introduce 2 new INIs for all platforms.

Pseudo RNG - non-blocking. INI_PERDIR
  random.entropy_strong_source=       (/dev/(u|a)random etc. Default: depends on platform)

RNG - may block. INI_PERDIR
  random.entropy_crypto_source=        (/dev/random etc. Default: depends on platform)

Appropriate default for the platform is detected during build time.

session.entropy_file uses /dev/*random. It share the random.entropy_strong_source if it is empty. (Like default_charset with Default Char Encoding RFC)

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.6


===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

session/mcrypt, any extension uses /dev/*random. These module's code is changed to use new INI settings where it is possible.

===== New Constants =====

None

===== php.ini Defaults =====

  * hardcoded default values

None, but appropriate values will bet set for the platform.

  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

  ;random.entropy_strong_source="/dev/urandom" (INI_PERDIR) 
  ;random.entropy_crypto_source="/dev/random" (INI_PERDIR)

Note: INI lines are commented out.

Under Windows, different values may be set.

===== Open Issues =====

None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Although this RFC affects some modules, it does not affects existing feature. All function should remains as it is now.

===== Future Scope =====

These 2 INIs may be used crypto related new and existing modules.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Yes/No

===== Patches and Tests =====

TBD

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====

Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
