This RFC proposes removal of PHP tags (''<?php'' and so forth) from the PHP scripting language.

===== Background =====

Since PHP was given birth by Rasmus Lerdorf as a tiny form interpreter for personal use, it has much evolved into a general-purpose scripting language, and is considered to be part of core technologies that are the basis of busiest websites to date.

The design of the language was heavily influenced by a number of predecessors such as ASP (Active Server Pages) in which one can easily build a dynamic web page by interleaving presentation elements with application logics, and it was well received by many developers who had to tackle with CGI at the time it got an attention.

However, as web application development got its way in the industry, it was discovered that MVC (model-view-controller) architecture, which effectively promotes the separation of concerns between the domain logic (models) and the presentation logic (views), could be the key concept of many kinds of web applications as well as GUI applications to build maintainable pieces of software.

At the same time, various web security issues became subject to public concern and the 'interleaving' method was pointed out to be too error-prone to create a secure website as it completely dismisses the context of the presentation elements where the application logic is inserted and so forces one to choose the correct escaping method suitable for putting the result of the logic in that place.

And today, many PHP programmers usually choose to use a web application framework that is based on MVC architecture and also takes advantage of modern template engines that feature handy syntax specific to describe common presentation logics. Not a few programmers may once have been bothered to put a PHP tag at the top of every PHP script that only contains classes and functions. In short, PHP tags are just ancient.

===== Proposal =====

  * Allow users to start PHP statements from the top of the script without putting open tags such as ''<?php''.
  * Complete removal of esoretic ''<script lanuage="PHP">'' open tag.
  * Allow open tags (''<?php'', ''<?'', ''<%'') only at the top of the script for compatibility, and issue a parse error when used in other places.
  * Ignore close tags (''?>'' and ''%>'') completely.

===== Issues yet to be resolved =====

  * Some of the scripts included in the distribution still utilizes the obsolete language feature and thus need some adjustment (those from phar for example.)
  * Education.
