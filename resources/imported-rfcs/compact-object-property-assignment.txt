  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2020-03-10
  * Author: Jakob Givoni <jakob@givoni.dk>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

==== Summary ====
**A pragmatic approach to mimicking object literals.**
This RFC proposes a new, compact syntax to assign values to multiple properties on an object in a single expression.

==== Example ====
<code php>
// Current syntax
$myObj->prop_a = 1;
$myObj->prop_b = 2;
$myObj->prop_c = 3;

// COPA syntax
$myObj->{
    prop_a = 1,
    prop_b = 2,
    prop_c = 3,
};
