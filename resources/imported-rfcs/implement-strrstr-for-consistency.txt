  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2019-06-20
  * Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/implement-strrstr-for-consistency

===== Introduction =====
Implement <php>strrstr</php> (and possibly <php>strristr</php>) for consistency with the <php>strpos</php> string functions family.


Currently there exist no "proper" counter part to the <php>strstr</php> (and <php>stristr</php>) standard string function.
There exist <php>strrchr</php> however it does not have the same signature as <php>strstr</php> nor <php>strchr</php> as <php>strchr</php> is an alias of <php>strstr</php>, nor does it provide the same features.

===== Proposal =====
Implement <php>strrstr</php> and <php>strristr</php> (?) in PHP 7.4 with the same features as <php>strstr</php>, meaning that the ''$needle'' parameter can accept multiple characters and add a boolean parameter ''$before_needle'' which has a default value of <php>false</php>.


===== Pros =====
  * Consistency within the standard library
  * Feature built-in to the language

===== Cons =====
  * More "bloat" in the global namespace
  * Follows an old naming scheme
  * Adds a function alias to the language
  * Easily implemented in userland

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next minor i.e. PHP 7.4.

===== Open Issues =====
How to handle the newly created alias.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
2/3 Majority for adding <php>strrstr</php> (and possibly <php>strristr</php> after discussion).

===== Patches and Tests =====
GitHub PR [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4064|#4064]]

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
