  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2019-06-20
  * Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/implement-strrstr-for-consistency

===== Introduction =====
Implement strrstr (and possibly strristr) for consistency with other string functions

===== Proposal =====
Currently there exist no "proper" counter par to the strstr (and stristr) standard string function.
There exist strrchr however it does not have the same signature as strstr nor strchr as strchr is an alias of strstr, nor does it provide the same features.

===== Pros =====
  * Consistency within the standard library
  * Feature built-in to the language

===== Cons =====
  * More "bloat" in the global namespace
  * Follows an old naming scheme
  * Adds a function alias to the language
  * Easely implemented in userland

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next minor i.e. PHP 7.4.

===== Open Issues =====
How to handle the newly created alias.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
2/3 Majority for adding strrstr (and possibly strristr after discussion).

===== Patches and Tests =====
GitHub PR [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4064|#4064]]

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs
