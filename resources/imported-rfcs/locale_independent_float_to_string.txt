====== PHP RFC: Locale-independent float to string cast ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2020-03-11
  * Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>, Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Status: Draft
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5224

===== Introduction =====
PHP's float's string representation depends on the current locale as the decimal separator varies between locales. This can lead to subtle bugs in certain locales (notably the German one) as the ''float'' to ''string'' cast won't yield the original value.

===== Proposal =====
Make PHP's float to string cast locale independent, meaning it will always use the dot ''.'' decimal separator, in PHP 8.0.

This has been raised multiple times over the years on the list [1] [2] and as bug reports [3] [4]

  * Although this double cast may seem nonsensical if we remain within PHP's boundaries, having a consistent string representation for floats is important. Such values may be sent to an external API using a protocol where everything is represented as strings, such as HTTP. Therefore, the external API might refuse these values as not well formed, or try to interpret as a numerical value by dropping everything past the decimal separator.
  * The behaviour is highly surprising and therefore does not follow the Principle of Least Astonishment. [5]
 
===== Alternative Approaches =====
An alternative approach would be to deprecate <php>setlocale()</php> all together as this would, as a by-product, fix this issue.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Outputting floats as a string in locales which change the decimal separator will have a slightly different output. As this is only a cosmetic change, this incompatibility is deemed minimal. To retain the old behaviour users should use the <php>number_format()</php> function or Intl's <php>NumberFormatter</php> class to format the number in the desired way.

===== Future Scope =====
None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
The primary vote ("Do you want to make the ''float'' to ''string'' cast always locale-independent?") requires 2/3 majority.
