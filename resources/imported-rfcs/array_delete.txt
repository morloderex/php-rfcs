====== Request for Comments: array_delete() for elements deletion ======
  * Version: 0.1

  * Author:  Rasmus Schultz <rasmus@mindplay.dk>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_delete
===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes the addition of a set of two new functions that simplify working with arrays containing a set of unique values or objects that do not have any natural (or distinct) scalar keys that can be used as indices.

While the array-type in PHP does not support set-semantics, these functions simplify working with a set of unique values or objects stored in an array.

===== New API for deleting elements =====

There is no array element deletion functions, but generic array_walk()/array_walk_recursive().

  int array_delete(&$array, callable)
  
  callable takes 2 arguments, element value as 1st, element key as 2nd(optional).
  If callable returns true, array_delete() deletes the element.
  
  array_delete() returns number of deleted elements. It returns false when error.

  int array_delete_recursive(&$array, callable)
  This is recursive version of array_delete()

===== Proposal and Patch =====
