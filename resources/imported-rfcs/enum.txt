===== Introduction =====

Enums are helpful when defining a finite set of strongly typed, mutually exclusive values.

===== Proposal =====

Enums are given a name and a finite set of unique values:
<PHP>
enum RenewalAction {
    Deny,
    Approve
}
</PHP>

Enum values can be used in switch statements:
<PHP>
switch ($action) {
    case RenewalAction::Approve:
        echo "approve";
        break;
    case RenewalAction::Deny:
        echo "deny";
        break;
}
</PHP>

Enums are strongly typed, so you can use them as parameter or return types:
<PHP>
function other(RenewalAction $action): RenewalAction {
    switch ($action) {
        case RenewalAction::Approve:
            return RenewalAction::Deny;
            
        case RenewalAction::Deny:
            return RenewalAction::Approve;
    }
}
f(RenewalAction::Approve);
</PHP>

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

The vote will be a simple "yes" or "no". This RFC requires 2/3 of the votes to be "yes" to pass. This RFC targets PHP version 7.1 .

===== Patches and Tests =====
