===== Introduction =====

The purpose behind this RFC is to introduce return type hinting to PHP class methods.  This RFC differs from the [[rfc:returntypehint|existing entry]] with a completely different concept and patch.  The language changes taken by this approach is, in my opinion, more advantageous because it provides a more familiar interface to method type hinting and uses the existing standard created by parameter type hinting.

==== Syntactical Changes ====

=== Approach ===

Languages like C# and Java provide an elegant syntactical approach to defining this:

<code>
[method_attributes] [return_type] [method_name] '(' parameters ')'
</code>

When writing this patch, I saw no reason diverge from this direction.  However, there was a caveat: PHP has the pseudo-type "mixed" which doesn't actually have a keyword.  To top this off, the existing definitions for methods require the keyword "function" in order for the language parser (zend_language_parser.y) to detect the entry.  Making a change to the language requiring a return type hint would break compatibility and be completely unacceptable.  Rather than this creating a challenge requiring a workaround, the BC issue actually resolved the issue!  Keeping the existing declaration using "function" could serve as the mixed type and maintain BC.

=== Using Existing PHP Standards ===

With the introduction to the new object model in PHP 5 came parameter type hinting.  Developers can
