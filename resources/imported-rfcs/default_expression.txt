====== PHP RFC: Default expression ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2024-08-21
  * Author: Paul Morris <bilge@scriptfusion.com>
  * Status: 
  * Target Version: PHP 8.5
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/15437
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/default_expression

===== Introduction =====

The only way to pass the default value to a function or method parameter is to not pass anything. This can be particularly difficult in some circumstances, because the language does not offer a way to pass //nothing//. This RFC proposes to make the existing keyword, <php>default</php>, the canonical way to pass the default value. Moreover, ''default'' becomes a valid expression in the function argument context, meaning it can be creatively combined with any and all existing PHP expression grammars to augment the default value as it is passed (see appendix for a comprehensive list of examples).

===== Proposal =====

All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.

If applicable, you may wish to use the language specification as a reference.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None known.

===== Future Scope =====

None planned.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As per the [[RFC/voting#required_majority|voting RFC]] a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.
