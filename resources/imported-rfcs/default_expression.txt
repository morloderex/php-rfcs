====== PHP RFC: Default expression ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2024-08-21
  * Author: Paul Morris <bilge@scriptfusion.com>
  * Status: 
  * Target Version: PHP 8.5
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/15437
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/default_expression

===== Introduction =====

The only way to pass the default value to a function or method parameter is to not pass anything. This can be particularly difficult in some circumstances, because the language does not offer a way to pass //nothing//. This RFC proposes to make the existing keyword, <php>default</php>, the canonical way to pass the default value. Moreover, ''default'' becomes a valid expression in the function argument context, meaning it can be creatively combined with any and all existing PHP expression grammars to augment the default value as it is passed (see appendix for a comprehensive list of examples).

===== Proposal =====


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None known.

===== Future Scope =====

None planned.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As per the [[RFC/voting#required_majority|voting RFC]] a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

==== Special thanks ====

The implementation for this feature was heavily subsidised by invaluable input from Ilija and Bob Weinand. In particular, Ilija assessed the feasibility and guided the implementation path, and Bob submitted the entire Bison grammar patch! Without them, this feature would either have been impossible or highly scuffed. They, along with everyone else whom supported me from R11, have my utmost thanks! ‚ù§
