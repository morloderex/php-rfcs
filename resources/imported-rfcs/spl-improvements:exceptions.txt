===== Introduction =====

The exceptions defined in the SPL are not very well documented, and their meanings are unclear. This RFC covers known problems and provides some solutions.

===== Problems =====

==== General Documentation Issues ====

  * There are no examples that show when to throw the specific exception.
  * Descriptions are too short.
==== Logic and Runtime Exceptions ====

=== What is a LogicException? ===

A LogicException is currently documented as:
"Exception that represents error in the program logic. This kind of exceptions should directly lead to a fix in your code."

**Known subclasses:**
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.badfunctioncallexception.php|BadFunctionCallException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domainexception.php|DomainException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.invalidargumentexception.php|InvalidArgumentException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.lengthexception.php|LengthException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.outofrangeexception.php|OutOfRangeException]]



=== What is a RuntimeEexception? ===

A RuntimeException is currently documented as:
"Exception thrown if an error which can only be found on runtime occurs."

**Known subclasses:**
