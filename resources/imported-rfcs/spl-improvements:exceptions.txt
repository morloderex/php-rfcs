====== SPL Improvements: Exceptions ======
  * Version: 1.0

  * Status: Work-in-progress

===== Introduction =====

The exceptions defined in the SPL are not very well documented, and their meanings are unclear. This RFC covers known problems and provides some solutions.

===== Problems =====

==== General Documentation Issues ====

  * There are no examples that show when to throw the specific exception.
  * Descriptions are too short.
==== Logic and Runtime Exceptions ====

=== What is a LogicException? ===

A LogicException is currently documented as:
"Exception that represents error in the program logic. This kind of exceptions should directly lead to a fix in your code."

**Known subclasses:**
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.badfunctioncallexception.php|BadFunctionCallException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domainexception.php|DomainException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.invalidargumentexception.php|InvalidArgumentException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.lengthexception.php|LengthException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.outofrangeexception.php|OutOfRangeException]]



=== What is a RuntimeEexception? ===

A RuntimeException is currently documented as:
"Exception thrown if an error which can only be found on runtime occurs."

**Known subclasses:**
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.outofboundsexception.php|OutOfBoundsException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.overflowexception.php|OverflowException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.rangeexception.php|RangeException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.underflowexception.php|UnderflowException]]
  * [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.unexpectedvalueexception.php|UnexpectedValueException]]
==== OutOfRange and OutOfBounds ====

==== Domain and Range ====

==== InvalidArgument ====

===== Proposed Solutions =====

==== Provide Inheritance Hierarchies ====

In the [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php|overview for SPL exceptions]], the table of contents lists all of the exceptions defined in the SPL. This should be changed to list the exception hierarchy:

  Exception
    LogicException
      BadFunctionCallException
        BadMethodCallException
      DomainException
      InvalidArgumentException
      LengthException
      OutOfRangeException
    RuntimeException
      OutOfBoundsException
      OverflowException
      RangeException
      UnderflowException
      UnexpectedValueException
      
Fortunately, [[http://us3.php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php#102226|Dawid Krysiak]] submitted it as a comment on 02 Feb 2011.  It would be helpful to also list the subclasses of each exception on their individual pages.
