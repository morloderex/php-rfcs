====== PHP RFC: Power Operator ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-11-23
  * Author: Tjerk Meesters, datibbaw@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/pow-operator

===== Introduction =====

This proposal covers the exponential operator  to complement the [[http://php.net/pow|pow()]] function. A few reasons why this could be useful:

  * It's easier to read and shorter to write.
  * It avoids a function call.
  * It can be found in other languages.

===== Proposal =====

The new syntax will allow to write exponents like this:

<code php>
echo 2 ** 3; // 8
</code>

It also supports GMP overloading:

<code php>
$base = gmp_init(2);
$exponent = 3;
var_dump($base ** $exponent);

// output
object(GMP)#3 (1) {
  ["num"]=>
  string(1) "8"
}
</code>


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 5.x" or "next PHP 5.x.y".


===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

The opcode ''ZEND_POW <165>'' is added, so extensions such as [[http://pecl.php.net/package/vld|vld]] or phpdbg would have to be updated.
===== New Constants =====

Describe any new constants so they can be accurately and comprehensively explained in the PHP documentation.


===== Open Issues =====

Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====

This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

===== Patches and Tests =====

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====

Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
