====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-04-15
  * Author: Chris Wright, daverandom@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string-bitwise-shifts

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes that the behaviour of bitwise shift operations on strings be altered to match the behaviour of bitwise shifts on integers.

===== Proposal =====
TODO

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Existing code that relies on the current behaviour will no longer produce the originally expected result. This can be easily resolved by explicitly casting the left operand to an integer.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
As this is a backwards-incompatible change, this RFC targets PHP 6.

===== Open Issues =====
Should right shifts shift copies of the left-most bits on, or always shift cleared bits?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Only bitwise shifts in user land where the left operand is a string are affected.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes or no.

===== Patches and Tests =====
A WIP branch can be seen [[https://github.com/DaveRandom/php-src/compare/string_bitwise_shifts|on Github]].

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

===== Rejected Features =====
None so far.
