====== PHP RFC: instanceof improvements ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2020-05-17
  * Author: Max Semenik, maxsem.wiki@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/instanceof_improvements

===== Introduction =====
As currently implemented, the `instanceof` operator is inconsistent.
<code php>
var_dump(new MyClass instanceof MyClass); // true
</code>
So far so good? What if we tried to use a scalar type? They can be specified as parameter types just like class names, right?
<code php>
$x = 123;
var_dump($x instanceof int); // false, right hand side is always treated as a class name
</code>

===== Proposal =====
Make ''instanceof'' support non-object types:
<code php>
var_dump('foo' instanceof string)       // true
var_dump('foo' instanceof ('string'))   // true
$type = 'string';
var_dump('foo' instanceof $type);       // true
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.1.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Will existing extensions be affected?

==== To Opcache ====
It is necessary to develop RFC's with opcache in mind, since opcache is a core extension distributed with PHP.

Please explain how you have verified your RFC's compatibility with opcache.

==== New Constants ====
Describe any new constants so they can be accurately and comprehensively explained in the PHP documentation.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This section details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
What should be done about this (improve instanceof / add new operator / reject this RFC)?

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
