====== PHP RFC: E_NOTICE for invalid container array-access ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-07-27
  * Author: David Walker (dave@mudsite.com)
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container

===== Introduction =====
PHP current array-access system works very well when attempting to access containers of type array, reference(to an array), and objects that implement ArrayAccess.  However, accessing elements not of those types results in a NULL value returned without any alert as to why it's null.  This feature has been requested in [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37676|37676]] and duplicated in at least [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39915|39915]] and [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72636|72636]].  PHP correctly returns a notice when you attempt to use an offset that is of an invalid type, PHP should also provide a notice when a container is of an invalid type.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposed to combine a couple of existing PR's as well as my implementation to raise a E_NOTICE when a container type is used that does not contain array-accessable data.  The default behavior, of a silent NULL return, is not correctly defined in the [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php|Array Documentation]] however is noted in a [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#111367|comment]]
