===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to define when PHP 5.3 serie won't be supported anymore. 

As PHP 5.3 was released before the new release process was defined and implemented, we have to define a clear EOL ((End of Life)).

===== Two years, one bug fixes and one security fixes only =====

One year with bugs fixes followed by one year with security fixes only.

Security issues cover only bugs marked as security issues or defined as such by the PHP Security team.



===== Option 2 =====

Two years with security fixes only

==== Pros ====

==== Cons ====

===== Option 3 =====

One year with bugs fixes (both security and normal bugs)

==== Pros ====

==== Cons ====

===== Option 4 =====

One year with security fixes only

==== Pros ====
