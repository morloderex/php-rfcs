===== Introduction =====

PHP, while generally stateless by default, occasionally provides forms of "persistence" for connections, e.g. [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.constants.php#pdo.constants.attr-persistent|PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT]] for persistent PDO connections.

Persistence allows PHP scripts to eliminate the overhead of establishing a connection on subsequent requests, which can improve performance and reliability.

''curl'', a popular URL transfer library made available as a core extension in PHP, provides the ability to share data between curl handles via a "share" interface. The PHP extension supports this functionality in ''curl_share_init'' and related functions.

The PHP extension does not, however, support persistent curl share handles. Connections (and DNS lookups, SSL session IDs, etc.) are only shared between handles within a single SAPI request.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to enable users to create persistent curl share handles, by modifying the signature of ''curl_share_init'' to accept a persistent ID: ''curl_share_init(?array $share_options, ?string $persistent_id)''.

When called with a persistent ID, the function will first check the global memory within the SAPI worker for an existing curl share handle. If found, the function will return immediately.

If a curl share handle does not already exist, the function will construct a new one, apply the given share options, store it in global memory, and return it.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP minor release.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

SAPIs will consume more memory proportional to the number of persistent curl share handles.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

''curl_share_init'' in ''ext/curl'' will have a new signature.

==== To Opcache ====

None.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

  * We may want to put together an RFC in the future for a new internal API for persistence.
