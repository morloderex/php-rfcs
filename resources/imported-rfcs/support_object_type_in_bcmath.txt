===== Introduction =====
BCMath currently only supports procedural functionality and does not support object types. Object-based programming is mainstream these days, so it's a bit outdated from that perspective. Also, the GMP extension, which is likely to have similar needs to BCMath, already supports object types.

Of course, it is also possible to treat BCMath like an object if you devise some ideas in userland. However, things like operator overloading cannot be implemented in userland.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes support for object types in BCMath. Please take a look at the usage example first.

<code>
$num = new BcNum('1');
$num2 = new BcNum('2');
$result = $num + $num2;

$result->value; // '3'
var_dump($num > $num2); // false
</code>

Operator overloading allows you to treat objects as if they were computing or comparing primitive values. Also, for reasons explained later, it supports not only calculations using operators, but also calculations using methods.

The following example is equivalent to the above example.

<code>
$num = new BcNum('1');
$num2 = new BcNum('2');
$result = $num->add($num2);

$result->value; // '3'
var_dump($num->gt($num2)); // false
</code>

`new BCMath()` is difficult to understand what "BCMath object" specifically refers to, so we will use "BcNum". The reason it's "BcNum" instead of "BCNum" is because it needs to follow current PHP naming conventions.

==== It is immutable ====
There is a concept called "value object" that is often seen in domain-driven design, etc., and BcNum is exactly what should be treated as a value object. That is, the object must be immutable.

No matter what we do, the original object remains unchanged and always returns a new object.

==== Stringable ====
In addition to referencing the value property to obtain the value of BcNum, you can also obtain the value by casting to the string type.
<code>
$num = new BcNum('1');
var_dump((string) $num); // '1'
</code>

==== Constructor ====

The constructor signature is:
<code>
public function __construct(string|int $num, ?int $scale = null) {}
</code>

Since there is no need to consider errors for integers in the range that can be represented by ints, it is reasonable to accept ints in the constructor.

$scale is optional. if omitted, the BCMath global setting will be used. Adjusts the digits in $num based on the scale set in the constructor. See code example.
<code>
$num = new BcNum('1.23456789', 4);
$num->value; // '1.2345'

$num2 = new BcNum('1', 4);
$num2->value; // '1.0000'
</code>

At this point, the digits are already adjusted. And, as explained later in the Methods section, **the global setting $scale is only used in the constructor**.

==== Poperties ====
(03/26 updated) This class has properties "value" and "scale". Both are read-only.

<code>
class BcNum
{
    public readonly string $value;
    public readonly int $scale;
}
</code>

==== Methods ====
In addition to calculations using operators, BcNum also supports calculations using methods. This is because BcMath is arbitrary precision mathematics, so the use of scales must be taken into account.

We cannot specify scale when calculating using operators, so if want to specify scale, use a method to calculate it.

Basically, it corresponds to the bcXXX functions. See stub.

<code>
class BcNum
{
    public function __construct(string|int $num, ?int $scale = null) {}

    public function add(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function sub(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function mul(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function div(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function mod(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function powmod(BcNum|string|int $exponent, string $modulus, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function pow(BcNum|string|int $exponent, ?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function sqrt(?int $scale = null): BcNum {}

    public function comp(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): int {}

    public function floor(): BcNum {}

    public function ceil(): BcNum {}

    public function round(int $precision = 0, int $mode = PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP): BcNum {}

    public function eq(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    public function gt(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    public function gte(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    public function lt(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    public function lte(BcNum|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    public function withScale(int $scale): BcNum {}
}
</code>

The bcXXX functions accept numbers to calculate as string, while BcNum accepts BcNum instance, string, and int.

=== Major difference from bcXXX functions ===
I think the differences in arguments are easy to understand, so I will omit them.

**The notable difference here is "behavior when $scale is not specified".**

For example, if omit $scale in bcadd, it will look like this:
<code>
bcadd('1.23', '2.111'); // Global settings are used. If set to 0, '3' is returned.
</code>

With BcNum it works like this:
<code>
$num = new BcNum('1.23', 2);
$num2 = new BcNum('2.111', 3);

// If scale is omitted, the larger scale of $num and $num2 is used.
// In this example, the scale of $num2 is larger, so the calculation is done with $scale = 3.
$result = $num->add($num2); // A BcNum containing '3.341' will be returned.
</code>

In this way, **the calculation of BcNum does not use the global setting $scale.**

If $num2 is not BcNum, the following behavior:
<code>
// $num2 is int
$num->add(4); // Equivalent to "$num->add(new BcNum('4', 0));"

// $num2 is string
$num->add('2.3355'); // Equivalent to "$num->add(new BcNum('2.3355', 4));"
</code>

=== Comparison method ===

These are equivalent to the following operators:
^ method ^ operator ^
| comp | <=> |
| eq | == |
| gt | > |
| gte | >= |
| lt | < |
| lte | <= |

=== withScale ===

withScale() sets the new scale. However, note that BcNum is immutable, so a new instance will be returned.
<code>
$num = new BcNum('1.23', 2);
$newNum = $num->withScale(4);

$num->scale; // 2
$newNum->scale; // 4

$num->value; // '1.23'
$newNum->value; // '1.2300'
</code>

==== Operator overload ====

See the table below for supported operators.

^ type ^ support ^
| comparison | yes |
| add | yes |
| sub | yes |
| mul | yes |
| div | yes |
| mod | yes |
| pow | yes |
| bit shift | no |
| bit wise | no |

The calculation with the operator is equivalent to not specifying scale in the method.

Therefore, calculations such as the following are allowed:

<code>
$num = new BcNum('1.23', 2);
$result = $num + 2;
$result->value; // '3.23'

$num = new BcNum('1.23', 2);
$result = $num + '1.23456';
$result->value; // '2.46456'
</code>

=== Increment and decrement ===

Incrementing and decrementing BcNum behaves similarly to GMP objects.

<code>
$num = new BcNum('1.23', 2);
$numA = $num;

$num++; // Here, $num will change to a new object.

$num->value; // '2.23'
$numA->value; // '1.23'
</code>

==== Exception ====
There are several times when you should throw an exception, such as division by 0. This is the same as the existing bcXXX functions. Therefore, we will not prepare a new exception class specifically for BcNum.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This is a new feature, so it doesn't break anything that already exists. The only concern is whether there is already a library that defines a class called "BcNum" without a namespace.

See search results on GitHub.
https://github.com/search?type=code&auto_enroll=true&q=%22new+BcNum%28%22+language%3APHP+

There's only one result, and it's my repository, so there's nothing wrong with it.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
I suggest implementing it in the next minor version (currently 8.4) or the next major version (currently 9.x).
Personally I'd like 8.4, but it might be worth a second vote on this. (Before that, it would be helpful if we could discuss this.)

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Only BCMath is affected.

==== To Opcache ====
None;

==== New Constants ====
None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
None.

===== Open Issues =====
None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
There is no effect on anything other than BCMath.

===== Future Scope =====
None;

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
There is a yes/no choice whether to accept this RFC and requires a 2/3 majority vote to be accepted.

(There may be a second vote on which PHP version to release.)
