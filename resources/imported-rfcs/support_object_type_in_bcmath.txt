====== PHP RFC: Support object type in BCMath ======
  * Version: 0.7
  * Date: 2024-03-24
  * Author: Saki Takamachi, saki@php.net
  * Status: Discussion
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/support_object_type_in_bcmath

===== Introduction =====
BCMath currently only supports procedural functionality and does not support object types. Object-based programming is mainstream these days, so it's a bit outdated from that perspective. Also, the GMP extension, which is likely to have similar needs to BCMath, already supports object types.

Of course, it is also possible to treat BCMath like an object if you devise some ideas in userland. However, things like operator overloading cannot be implemented in userland.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes support for object types in BCMath. Please take a look at the usage example first.

<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1');
$num2 = new Number('2');
$result = $num + $num2;

$result->value; // '3'
var_dump($num > $num2); // false
</code>

Operator overloading allows you to treat objects as if they were computing or comparing primitive values. Also, it supports not only calculations using operators, but also calculations using methods.

The following example is equivalent to the above example.

<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1');
$num2 = new Number('2');
$result = $num->add($num2);

$result->value; // '3'
var_dump($num->gt($num2)); // false
</code>

`new BCMath()` is difficult to understand what "BCMath object" specifically refers to, so we will use "Number".

(Updated 03/26)
One important thing to note first: existing global settings related to scale are not used by Number. Therefore, **no matter what is set in the global settings, it has no effect on the behavior of Number**.

==== namespace ====
(updated 03/27)
Use namespace "BCMath" for this class according to the following RFC:
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/namespaces_in_bundled_extensions

In the RFC example, the symbols use common names, so I follow suit and use the symbol "Number".

Therefore, the fully qualified name of the class would be:
<code>
BCMath\Number;
</code>

==== It is immutable ====
There is a concept called "value object" that is often seen in domain-driven design, etc., and Number is exactly what should be treated as a value object. That is, the object must be immutable.

No matter what we do, the original object remains unchanged and always returns a new object.

==== Stringable ====
In addition to referencing the value property to obtain the value of Number, you can also obtain the value by casting to the string type.
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1');
var_dump((string) $num); // '1'
</code>

==== Constructor ====

The constructor signature is:
<code>
public function __construct(string|int $num, int $maxExpansionScale = 10, int $roundMode = PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO) {}
</code>

Since there is no need to consider errors for integers in the range that can be represented by ints, it is reasonable to accept ints in the constructor.

(Updated 04/04)
**The scale of the value is always implicitly calculated from the given $num.**

In many cases, Number Class can automatically calculate the scale of the calculation result. However, in three cases, when using a div, sqrt and when the pow's exporent is a negative value, the scale cannot be determined automatically if the value is not divisible. In some cases, calculations need to continue indefinitely. This is not reasonable, so in these three cases the calculation must be stopped midway.

`$maxExpansionScale` specifies the maximum scale of the result in these three cases. However, please note that this is a relative value. Adds the value specified by `$maxExpansionScale` to the implicit scale of the left operand and uses it as the maximum scale value in the calculation.

Since sqrt doesn't involve operator overloading, you can also require scale in the method argument. However, from a consistency point of view, I will use the same specifications as div etc.

In addition to these three cases, `$roundMode` is used when scale is specified in the `format` method and comparison methods. Specifies how to round the value when the calculation is stopped midway due to the maximum scale. The default value is `PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO`, which has the same behavior as the BCMath function.

powmod has some restrictions on the arguments, so it will not prevent from automatically calculating the scale.

See code example.
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('2'); // value is '2'
$num->div('3'); // value is '0.6666666666', max scale is 0 + 10 = 10

$num = new Number('1'); // value is '1'
$num->div('2'); // value is '0.5', max scale is 0 + 10 = 10, but the result is less than the max scale, so it becomes 1

$num = new Number('2', 5, PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP); // value is '2'
$num->div('3'); // value is '0.66667', max scale is 0 + 5 = 5, round mode is PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP

$num = new Number('1.2345', 2); // value is '1.2345'
$num / 7; // value is '0.176357', max scale is 4 + 2 = 6
</code>

In this way, by receiving several option settings in the constructor, we eliminate the differences between calculations using operator overloads and methods as much as possible.

More detailed examples are provided later in the RFC.

==== Poperties ====
(03/26 updated) This class has properties "value", "scale", "maxExpansionScale" and "roundMode". These are read-only.

<code>
namespace BcMath;

class Number
{
    public readonly string $value;
    public readonly int $scale;
    public readonly int $maxExpansionScale;
    public readonly int $roundMode;
}
</code>

==== Methods ====
(updated 3/27)
(updated 4/4)
Only div, pow, and sqrt accept $maxExpansionScale as an option. This means the same thing as $maxExpansionScale in the constructor, and allows you to use any $maxExpansionScale when calculating rather than the one from the constructor. Also, comparison methods and `format` methods receive $scale as an argument. This is optional.

Also, since it is not ideal for users to customize operator overloads, all computational methods should be final. Then, from a consistency perspective and because there is no common use case to override Number's methods to change their behavior, we make all methods final. In reality, operator overload calculations and method calculations follow different processing paths, so users cannot customize the behavior of operators via methods, but from the perspective of consistency of behavior, they should be final.

The Number class itself should be extensible. By doing so, the user can use the NumberChild class by adding any method. This is a very common use case, as BCMath's main use case is money calculations.

In addition to calculations using operators, Number also supports calculations using methods. 
Basically, it corresponds to the bcXXX functions. See stub.

<code>
namespace BCMath;

class Number
{
    public function __construct(string|int $num, int $maxExpansionScale = 10, int $roundMode = PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO) {}

    final public function add(Number|string|int $num): Number {}

    final public function sub(Number|string|int $num): Number {}

    final public function mul(Number|string|int $num): Number {}

    final public function div(Number|string|int $num, ?int $maxExpansionScale = null): Number {}

    final public function mod(Number|string|int $num): Number {}

    final public function powmod(Number|string|int $exponent, string $modulus): Number {}

    final public function pow(Number|string|int $exponent, ?int $maxExpansionScale = null): Number {}

    final public function sqrt(?int $maxExpansionScale = null): Number {}

    final public function floor(): Number {}

    final public function ceil(): Number {}

    final public function round(int $precision = 0, int $mode = PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP): Number {}
    
    final public function comp(Number|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): int {}

    final public function eq(Number|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    final public function gt(Number|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    final public function gte(Number|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    final public function lt(Number|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}

    final public function lte(Number|string|int $num, ?int $scale = null): bool {}
  
    final puclic function format(?int $scale = null, string $decimalSeparator = '.', string $thousandsSeparator = ''): string {}

    final public function with(int $maxExpansionScale, int $roundMode): Number {}

    final public function withMaxExpansionScale(int $maxExpansionScale): Number {}
    
    final public function withRoundMode(int $roundMode): Number {}
    
    final public function __toString(): string {}
}
</code>

The bcXXX functions accept numbers to calculate as string, while Number accepts Number instance, string, and int.

=== Just to clarify ===

Some methods accept `$scale`. We can achieve the same result by adjusting the values using `round` beforehand. However, temporarily adjusting the scale is a very common use case, so rounding every time is a hassle. Therefore, I have made it possible to easily specify scale as an argument. It is for the same reason that `$maxExpansionScale` is provided as an argument.

On the other hand, you may be wondering why `$roundMode` is not an argument. In most common use cases, the rounding mode is consistent throughout the application, and there are not many use cases where you want to change it individually. Therefore, I decided not to provide an argument for rounding mode. If you need such behavior, you can use `withRoundMode` to change the rounding mode and then calculate.

=== Major difference from bcXXX functions ===
I think the differences in arguments are easy to understand, so I will omit them.

**The notable difference here is "handling of scale".**

For example, the existing behavior of bcadd is:
<code>
bcadd('1.23', '2.111'); // Global settings are used. If set to 0, '3' is returned.
bcadd('1.23', '2.111', 1); // '3.3' is returned.
</code>

With Number it works like this:
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$num2 = new Number('2.111');

// If scale is omitted, the larger scale of $num and $num2 is used.
// In this example, the scale of $num2 is larger, so the calculation is done with scale = 3.
$result = $num->add($num2); // A Number containing '3.341' will be returned.
</code>

In this way, **when calculating Number, scale is automatically determined.**

If $num2 is not Number, the following behavior:
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

// $num2 is int
$num->add(4); // Equivalent to "$num->add(new Number('4'));"

// $num2 is string
$num->add('2.3355'); // Equivalent to "$num->add(new Number('2.3355'));"
</code>

(updated 3/27)
(updated 4/4)
When calculating, the value is always implicitly converted to the bc_num structure that Number has internally.

=== Comparison method ===

These are equivalent to the following operators:
^ method ^ operator ^
| comp | <=> |
| eq | == |
| gt | > |
| gte | >= |
| lt | < |
| lte | <= |

However, if specify $scale as a method argument, the comparison will be performed using up to the specified scale, like the existing `bccomp`. When comparing using operator overloads, it is purely comparing values.

=== format ===
(updated 4/4)
This behaves similar to number_format. However, the arguments are slightly different. See code example:

<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('123456.789'); // round mode is  PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO

$num->format(); // '123456.789'
$num->format(1); // '123456.7'
$num->format(1, '.', ','); // '123,456.7'

$num->format(2, ',', ' '); // '123 456,78' french notation

$num2 = new Number('123456.789', 10, PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP);
$num->format(); // '123456.789'
$num->format(1); // '123456.8'
$num->format(2, '.', ','); // '123,456.79'
</code>

=== with, withMaxExpansionScale, withRoundMode ===
(updated 4/4)
Each generates and returns a new instance with the constructor option values reset.
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23', 5, PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP);
$newNum = $num->withMaxExpansionScale(2); // same as new Number('1.23', 2, PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP)
$newNum = $num->withRoundMode(PHP_ROUND_HALF_EVEN); // same as new Number('1.23', 5, PHP_ROUND_HALF_EVEN)
$newNum = $num->with(8, PHP_ROUND_HALF_ODD); // same as new Number('1.23', 8, PHP_ROUND_HALF_ODD)
</code>

==== Operator overload ====

See the table below for supported operators.

^ type ^ support ^
| comparison | yes |
| add | yes |
| sub | yes |
| mul | yes |
| div | yes |
| mod | yes |
| pow | yes |
| bit shift | no |
| bit wise | no |

Calculations with the operator behave as if the corresponding method's optional arguments were not specified.

Therefore, calculations such as the following are allowed:

(updated 3/27)
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$result = $num + 2;
$result->value; // '3.23'
$result->scale; // 2

$num = new Number('1.23');
$result = $num + '1.23456';
$result->value; // '2.46456'
$result->scale; // 5
</code>

=== Increment and decrement ===

Incrementing and decrementing Number behaves similarly to GMP objects.

<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23', 2);
$numA = $num;

$num++; // Here, $num will change to a new object.

$num->value; // '2.23'
$numA->value; // '1.23'
</code>

==== Exception ====
There are several times when you should throw an exception, such as division by 0. This is the same as the existing bcXXX functions. Therefore, we will not prepare a new exception class specifically for Number.

==== Detailed examples ====
(updated 4/4)
I mainly provide examples to help  understand how to determine scale.

=== add ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$num2 = new Number('2.000000');
$result = $num + $num2; // value is '3.230000', The larger scale of the two values is applied. (2 < 6, so 6 is used)
</code>

=== sub ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$num2 = new Number('2.000000');
$result = $num - $num2; // value is '-0.770000', The larger scale of the two values is applied. (2 < 6, so 6 is used)
</code>

=== mul ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$num2 = new Number('2.456');
$result = $num * $num2; // value is '3.02088', The resulting scale is the sum of the scales of the two values. (2 + 3 = 5)

$num = new Number('1.25');
$num2 = new Number('4.00');
$result = $num * $num2; // value is '5.0000', The resulting scale is the sum of the scales of the two values. (2 + 2 = 4)
</code>

=== div ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23'); // $maxExpansionScale is 10
$num2 = new Number('3.333');
$result = $num / $num2; // value is '0.369036903690', The max scale is the sum of the dividend scale and $maxExpansionScale. (2 + 10 = 12)

$num = new Number('1.25'); // $maxExpansionScale is 10
$num2 = new Number('5.00');
$result = $num / $num2; // value is '0.25', The result fits within the maximum scale, so an implicit scale of 2 is set.
</code>

=== mod ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('6.234');
$num2 = new Number('1.23');
$result = $num % $num2; // value is '0.084', Use the scale of the dividend as is. (3)
</code>

=== powmod ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('4');
$exponent = new Number('5');
$modulus = new Number('3');
$result = $num->powmod($exponent, $modulus); // value is '1', The scale is always 0 because the result is always an integer.
</code>

=== pow ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$exponent = new Number('3');
$result = $num ** $exponent; // value is '1.860867', The value of the left operand scale multiplied by exponent becomes the resulting scale. (2 * 3 = 6)

$num = new Number('1.23');
$exponent = new Number('0');
$result = $num ** $exponent; // Scale is always 0 because the 0th power is always 1.

$num = new Number('1.23'); // $maxExpansionScale is 10
$exponent = new Number('-3');
$result = $num ** $exponent; // value is '0.537383918356', The maximum scale is the sum of the left operand's scale and $maxExpansionScale. (2 + 10 = 12)
</code>

=== sqrt ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23'); // $maxExpansionScale is 10
$result = $num->sqrt(); // value is '1.109053650640', The max scale is the sum of the $num scale and $maxExpansionScale. (2 + 10 = 12)

$num = new Number('16.00'); // $maxExpansionScale is 10
$result = $num->sqrt(); // value is '4', The result fits within the maximum scale, so an implicit scale of 0 is set.
</code>

=== floor ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$result = $num->floor(); // value is '1', The scale is always 0 because the result is always an integer.

use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$result = $num->round(1); // value is '1.2', Implicitly sets the scale from the rounded value.
</code>

=== comparison methods ===
<code>
use BcMath\Number;

$num = new Number('1.23');
$num2 = new Number('1,23456');

$num->comp($num2); // -1, Same as '1.23' <=> '1.23456'
