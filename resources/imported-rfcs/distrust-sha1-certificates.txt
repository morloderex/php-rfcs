====== PHP RFC: Distrust SHA-1 Certificates ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-11-25
  * Author: Niklas Keller <me@kelunik.com>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/distrust-sha1-certificates

===== Introduction =====

As of 2016-01-01, the CA/B Forum forbids issuing new SHA-1 certificates. The CA/B has advised CAs starting 2015-01-16 to issue no SHA-1 certificates with an expiration date greater than 2017-01-01, as browsers had already announced (see references) to deprecate and remove SHA-1. [[http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf|NIST recommends that SHA-1 should no longer be used for digital signatures]]. Starting with Java 9, [[http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/288|Java will also no longer accept SHA-1 starting 2017-01-01 by default]]. [[http://php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php|PHP does not even provide a context option]], yet.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to add a new context option that defines the accepted hash functions. This context option defaults to accepting SHA-1 and SHA-256 in PHP 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1. Starting with PHP 7.2, this will default to SHA-256 only.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

SHA-1 certificates are no longer accepted by default starting in PHP 7.2. This change already happens to be almost a year late, as PHP 7.2 is expected to be released near 2017-12-01. This change is justified by the new CA/B rules, browser changes and thus industry standards.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2. Only 7.2 defaults to the new behavior.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== New Constants ====

TBD.

===== Future Scope =====

Once SHA-256 should be become obsolete, the default can be adjusted accordingly.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Requires a 2/3 majority.

===== Patches and Tests =====

TBD.

===== Implementation =====

TBD.
