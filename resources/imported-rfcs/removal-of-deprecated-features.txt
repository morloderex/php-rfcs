===== Introduction =====
This RFC focuses on removing old and long time deprecated features from the next version of PHP. Patches for each of these features will be made for the features that is going to be removed if this RFC or parts of it is accepted.

===== Features =====
  * __safe_mode/register_globals/register_long_arrays/magic_quotes_*/allow_call_time_pass_reference__ - Original to be removed in PHP6, there isn't much point in keeping the deprecation warning in the next version of PHP, no matter if its a major or minor version - See also the [[rfc:magicquotes]] RFC
  * __define_syslog_variables__ and its associated function - Originally agreed to be removed in PHP6 during the PHP 5.3 development
  * __asp_tags__ - Was on the old PHP6 todo list for discussion
  * __sql_safe_mode__ - See also the [[rfc:drop_sql.safe_mode]] RFC
  * __y2k_compliance__ - Always enable this ini option, we are in 2010 now. This shouldn't cause any other breakage, perhaps Derick have a comment here?
  * __detect_unicode/highlight_bg__ - Marked in the manual as a removed features of PHP6, perhaps worth revisiting
  * __enable_dl__ - Worth keeping since its only available in CLI/CGI/Embed?
  * __Class named constructors__ - Also a feature thats been in the manual as something that should be avoided and would be removed in a coming version of PHP
  * __session_register/session_is_registered/session_unregister functions__ - Only needed for register_globals=On
  * __session.bug_compat_42__ and __session.bug_compat.warn__ - As discussed for the old PHP6
  * __pdo_odbc.db2_instance_name__ - Why?
  * __undocumented and incomplete support for strings in list() operator__ - As from the old PHP6 NEWS file
  * __Support for Freetype 1 and GD 1__
  * __Support for "continue" and "break" operators with non-constant operands__

===== Comments =====
  * Make a list of all deprecated features in PHP, including all that throw an E_DEPRECATED level error
  * Make a list of all "unofficial" deprecated features that may not throw errors, like all the old mysql aliases
  * Determine when/if these will ever be removed from PHP
