===== Introduction =====

This RFC introduces pattern matching syntax for PHP.  //[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching|Pattern Matching]]// as a language concept contains two parts: Matching a variable against a potentially complex data structure pattern, and optionally extracting values out of that variable into their own variables.  In a sense it serves a similar purpose for complex data structures as regular expressions do for strings.  When properly applied, it can lead to very compact but still readable code, especially when combined with conditional structures such as ''match()''.  It does not, however, nor is it intended to, represent every possible type of comparison that could be imagined: Just the most common, in a more compact and readable form.

Pattern matching is found in a number of languages, including Python, Haskell, C#, ML, Rust, and Swift, among others.  The syntax offered here draws inspiration from several of them, but is not a direct port of any.

This RFC is part of the [[rfc:adts|Algebraic Data Types Epic]].  It is a stepping stone toward full Algebraic Data Types (Enums with associated values) but stands on its own as useful functionality.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC introduces a new keyword and binary operator: ''is''.  The ''is'' keyword indicates that its right hand side is a pattern against which its left hand side should be applied.  The ''is'' operator is technically a comparison operator, and always returns a boolean ''true'' or ''false''.

<code php>
if($var is <pattern>) {

}
</code>

The left-hand side of ''is'' will be evaluated first until it is reduced to a single value (which could be an arbitrarily complex object or array).  That value will then be compared to the pattern, and ''true'' or ''false'' returned.

While patterns may resemble other language constructs, whatever follows ''is'' is a pattern, not some other instruction.

''is'' may be used in any context in which a boolean result is permissible.  That includes variable assignment, ''if'' conditions, ''while'' conditions, ''match()'' expressions, etc.

==== Pattern structure ====

Patterns are a super-set of type definitions.  A pattern consists of one or more pattern segments, combined by <php>|</php> and <php>&</php> conjunctions.  If both are used, patterns must be in Disjunctive Normal Form (And ORed list of ANDs), and each segment must be enclosed in parentheses.  These are the same rules that apply to compound types already.

==== Supported patterns ====

=== Type pattern ===

A pattern may be a type signature, including both class and primitive types as well as compound types.  In this case, ''is'' will match the left hand side value against the specified type.  That is, the following are all legal:

<code php>
$foo is string;    // Equivalent to is_string($foo)
$foo is Request;   // Equivalent to $foo instanceof Request
$foo is ?array;    // Equivalent to is_array($foo) || is_null($foo)
$foo is float;     // Equivalent to is_int($foo) || is_float($foo), for consistency with types.

// These are compound patterns, consisting of two sub-patterns each.
$foo is int|float; // Equivalent to is_int($foo) || is_float($foo)
$foo is User|int;  // Equivalent to $foo instanceof User || is_int($foo)
$foo is string|Stringable; // Equivalent to is_string($foo) || $string instanceof Stringable

// This is also a compound pattern. It is equivalent to:
// $foo instanceof User || ($foo instanceof Account && $foo instanceof Authenticated)
$foo is User|(Account&Authenticated)
</code>

Type patterns are always evaluated in strict mode, so as to be consistent with <php>is_int()</php> and its siblings.

A type match may be any syntax supported by a parameter type; in a sense, ''$foo is pattern'' is equivalent to "would $foo pass a type check if passed to a parameter with this type specification in strict mode."  Should more complex type checks become allowed (such as type aliases, etc.) they will become valid in a pattern as well.  Note that, as shown in the 4th example above, an integer will pass a pattern match for type <php>float</php>.  That is consistent with how strict type declarations work today.

=== Literal pattern ===

Any literal may be a pattern.  When used on its own it is not particularly useful (it's equivalent to <php>===</php>), but can be used in a compound pattern to more complex effect.  It is also valuable when used with ''match()'' (see below).

<code php>
// Simple degenerate case patterns.
$foo is 5;         // Equivalent to $foo === 5
$foo is 'yay PHP'; // Equivalent to $foo === 'yay PHP'

// More practical compound example
$foo is "beep"|"boop"; // Equivalent to $foo === "beep" || $foo === "boop"
</code>

=== Built-in constants pattern ===

There are three constant values built-in that can be used directly: <php>true</php>, <php>false</php>, and <php>null</php>.  They function essentially the same as a literal pattern as far as the user is concerned, but for implementation reasons are handled slightly differently internally.  As with literal patterns, their use stand-alone is minimal but they are useful in compound patterns or ''match()'' expressions.

<code php>
// Simple degenerate case patterns.
$foo is true;      // Equivalent to $foo === true
$foo is null;      // Equivalent to $foo === null

// More practical compound examples
$foo is array|null; // Equivalent to is_array($foo) || $foo === null
$foo is "Aardvark"|"Bear"|null // Equivalent to $foo === "Aardvark" || $foo === "Bear" || $foo === null
</code>

=== Class constant pattern ===

Class constants may also be used as a pattern:

<PHP>
$foo is 'spade'|'heart'|self::Wild;
</PHP>

Global constants may not be used directly, as they cannot be differentiated from class names.  However, they may be used in expression patterns (see next section).

=== Limited expression pattern ===

The use of variables directly in a pattern is not supported, as it would conflict with variable binding below.  However, they may be included by delineating them within <php>@()</php>.  This approach also works for global constants.  As with literals, they are useful mainly in compound patterns and <php>match()</php>.

<code php>
// Simple degenerate case patterns.
$foo is @($bar); // Equivalent to $foo === $bar
$foo is @(PHP_VERSION); // Equivalent to $foo === PHP_VERSION

// More practical compound expressions
$foo is @(Errors::NotFound)|@(Errors::Invalid); // Equivalent to $foo === Errors::NotFound || $foo === Errors::Invalid
</code>

It would be possible to expand this pattern to support arbitrary expressions within the delimiters, including function calls.  However, that has been omitted at this time in the interest of simplicity.  If a good use case for it can be shown in the future, that can be added in a backward compatible way, however.

=== Object property pattern ===

A pattern may also define a class and matches against scope-accessible properties of that object.  Only a single class type may be used, but any number of properties may be matched.  The properties must be accessible in the scope in which the pattern executes.  That is, a pattern evaluated outside the class may only match against public properties; a pattern inside the class may match against public, private, or protected; a pattern in a child class may match against protected properties of its parent but not private; etc.

<code php>

class Point {
    public function __construct(
        public int $x, 
        public int $y, 
        public int $z,
    ) {}
}

$p = new Point(3, 4, 5);

$p is Point {x: 3};
// Equivalent to:
$p instanceof Point && $p->x === 3;

$p is Point {y: 37, x: 2,};
// Equivalent to:
$p instanceof Point && $p->y === 37 && $p->x === 2;

// A multi-segment pattern that includes an object pattern.
$p is Point {x: 2}|null
// Equivalent to:
$p instanceof Point && $p->x === 2 || $p === null;
</code>

Properties may be listed in any order, but must be named.  A trailing comma is permitted.

==== match() enhancement ====

Pattern matching is frequently used in conjunction with branching structures, in particular with enumerations.  To that end, this RFC also enhances the ''match()'' structure.  Specifically, if the ''is'' keyword is used in ''match()'' then ''match()'' will perform a pattern match rather than an identity comparison.

That is, this code:

<code php>
$result = match ($somevar) is {
    Foo => 'foo',
    Bar => 'bar',
    Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

is equivalent to the following:

<code php>
$result = match (true) {
    $somevar is Foo => 'foo',
    $somevar is Bar => 'bar',
    $somevar is Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

(See "Open Questions" below regarding the syntax for <php>match()</php> with patterns.)

==== Variable binding ====

One of the prime uses of pattern matching is to extract a value from a larger structure, such as an object (or Enumeration/ADT, in the future).  This RFC supports such variable binding by specifying the variable to populate.  If the input variable matches the rest of the pattern, then the corresponding value will be extracted and assigned to a variable of that name in the current scope.  It will remain in scope as long as normal variable rules say it should.  Only local variables may be bound, that is, you cannot bind to a property of an object.

The entire pattern either succeeds or fails.  No variables will be bound unless the entire pattern matches.

In the currently supported patterns, it is only relevant for object and array pattern matching.  (See the next section for array examples.)

<code php>
class Point {
    public function __construct(
        public int $x, 
        public int $y, 
        public int $z,
    ) {}
}

$p = new Point(3, 4, 5);

if ($p is Point {x: 3, y: $y} ) {
    print "x is 3 and y is $y.";
}
// Equivalent to:
if ($p instanceof Point && $p->x === 3) {
    $y = $p->y;
    print "x is 3 and y is $y.";
}

if ($p is Point {z: $z, x: 3, y: $y} ) {
  print "x is 3 and y is $y and z is $z.";
}
// Equivalent to:
if ($p instanceof Point && $p->x === 3) {
    $y = $p->y;
    $z = $p->z;
    print "x is 3 and y is $y and z is $z.";
}
</code>

Variable binding is not compatible with an ORed compound pattern, as depending on the segment that matches the variable may or may not end up defined, and there's no reliable way to determine that other than <php>isset()</php>.  An ANDed compound pattern is permitted, however.

If the variable name to extract to is the same as the name of the property, then the property name may be omitted.  That is, the last example can be abbreviated as:

<code php>
if ($p is Point {$z, x: 3, $y} ) {
  print "x is 3 and y is $y and z is $z.";
}
</code>

Variable binding is especially useful in ''match()'' statements, where there is no simple logical equivalent that doesn't involve additional functions.

<code php>
$result = match ($p) is {
  // These will match only some Point objects, depending on their property values.
  Point{x: 3, y: 9, $z} => "x is 3, y is 9, z is $z",
  Point{$z, $x, y: 4} => "x is $x, y is 4, z is $z",
  Point{x: 5, $y} => "x is 5, y is $y, and z doesn't matter",
  // This will match any Point object.
  Point{$x, $y, $z} => "x is $x, y is $y, z is $z",
};
</code>

Note that in this case, the variables ''$x'', ''$y'', and ''$z'' may or may not be defined after the ''match()'' statement executes depending on which pattern was matched.

This last usage is especially important in the context of ADTs, where combining an ADT with a pattern-matching <php>match()</php> would allow for this:

<PHP>
// Example of what is possible with both pattern matching and ADTs,
// though they are separate RFCs so the exact syntax is subject to change.

enum Move {
    case TurnLeft;
    case TurnRight;
    case Forward(int $amount);
}

match ($move) is {
    Move::TurnLeft => $this->orientation--,
    Move::TurnRight => $this->orientation++,
    Move::Forward{$amount} => $this->distance += $amount,
};


enum Option {
    case None;
    case Some(mixed $val);
}

match ($maybe) is {
    Option::Some {$val} => compute_something($val),
    Option::None => 'default value',
}
</PHP>

We view this RFC as a prerequisite for ADTs being useful in practice.

==== Array structure pattern ====

Array patterns match elements of an array individually against a collection of values.  It has two variants, positional or associative.  That is, the pattern MUST be entirely positional, or must specify a key for every position.  (This is in contrast to array literals, which allow keys to be omitted at random to get an integer assigned.)  If an associative pattern is used, the order of keys is explicitly irrelevant.

By default, array matching is exhaustive.  That is, the arity of the array and pattern must match.  Alternatively, the pattern may include a <php>...</php> sequence as its last item to disable that arity checking, rendering any unspecified array keys explicitly irrelevant.

<code php>
// Given:
$list = [1, 3, 5, 7];

// Degenerate, not very useful case.
if ($list is [1, 3, 5, 7]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && count($list) === 4 
    && $list[0] === 1 
    && $list[1] === 3 
    && $list[2] === 5 
    && $list[4] === 7
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}


if ($list is [1, 3]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// False.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && count($list) === 2
    && $list[0] === 1 
    && $list[1] === 3
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($list is [1, 3, ...]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && array_key_exists($list, 0) && $list[0] === 1 
    && array_key_exists($list, 1) && $list[1] === 3
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($list is [1, 3, $third, 7]) {
  print "Yes: $third";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && count($list) === 4
    && $list[0] === 1 
    && $list[1] === 3
    && $list[3] === 7
    ) {
    $third = $list[2];
    print "Yes: $third";
}


if ($list is [1, 3, $third, ...]) {
  print "Yes: $third";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && array_key_exists($list, 0) && $list[0] === 1 
    && array_key_exists($list, 1) && $list[1] === 3
    && array_key_exists($list, 2)
    ) {
    $third = $list[2];
    print "Yes: $third";
}
</code>

<code php>
// Given:
$assoc = ['a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B'];

// Degenerate, not very useful case.
if ($assoc is ['a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B']) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 2 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'a') && $assoc['a'] === 'A'
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === 'B'
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($assoc is ['a' => 'A', 'b' => @($b)]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 2 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'a') && $assoc['a'] === 'A'
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === $b
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($assoc is ['a' => 'A', 'b' => $b]) {
  print "Yes: $b";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 2 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'a') && $assoc['a'] === 'A'
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b')
    ) {
    $b = $assoc['b'];
    print "Yes: $b";
}

if ($assoc is ['b' => 'B']) {
  print "Yes";
}
// False.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 1 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === 'B'
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($assoc is ['b' => 'B', ...]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === 'B') {
    print "Yes";
}
</code>

Of particular note, the pattern matching approach automatically handles <php>array_key_exists()</php> checking.  That means a missing array element will not trigger a warning, whereas with a traditional <php>if ($foo['bar'] === 'baz')</php> approach missing values must be accounted for by the developer manually.  That provides some benefit in even the degenerate case of just checking a selection of keys against literal values, as missing values are handled automatically.

==== Variable binding pattern matching ====

When binding to a variable, the <php>is</php> keyword may be nested.  In that case, the entire pattern must succeed or fail.  Values will be bound if and only if all binding patterns match as well.

For example:

<code php>
if ($foo is Foo{a: @($someA), $b is Point(x: 5, y: @($someY)) }) {
  print "x is 5, y is $someY, z is $b->z";
}
// Equivalent to:
if ($foo instanceof Foo
    && $foo->a === $someA
    && $bar instanceof Point
    && $bar->y = $someY
    ) {
    $b = $foo->b;
    print "x is 5, y is $someY, z is $b->z";
}
</code>

<code php>
if ($params is ['user' => $user is AuthenticatedUser{role: 'admin'}, ...]) {
    print "Congrats, $user->name, you can do admin things!"
}
// Equivalent to:
if (is_array($params)
    && array_key_exists($params, 'user')
    && $params['user'] instanceof AuthenticatedUser
    && $params['user']->role === 'admin'
    ) {
    $user = $params['user'];
    print "Congrats, $user->name, you can do admin things!"
}
</code>


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

A new keyword is added, ''is''.  That will conflict with any user-defined global constant named ''is''.

No other BC breaks are expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.next (aka 8.4).

===== RFC Impact =====

===== Open Issues =====

==== Include other patterns in the initial RFC? ====

Do any other patterns need to be included in the initial RFC?  Are there any listed in Future Scope that are must-have for the initial release?

==== Expression pattern syntax ====

The @() syntax for expression patterns is still an open question.  It needs some kind of delimeter to differentiate it from class names and binding variables, but the specific syntax we are flexible on.

==== match() "is" placement ====

The authors are split as to how the syntax for pattern matching <php>match()</php> should work.  There are two options:

<code php>
$result = match ($somevar) is {
    Foo => 'foo',
    Bar => 'bar',
    Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

<code php>
$result = match ($somevar) {
    is Foo => 'foo',
    is Bar => 'bar',
    is Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

The former is shorter, and applies pattern matching to all arms.  The latter is more explicit, and would allow individual arms to be pattern matched or not depending on the presence of ''is''.  Of course, these options are not mutually exclusive and supporting both would be possible.  We are looking for feedback on this question.

===== Future Scope =====

Numerous other patterns can be supported in the future.  The following additional patterns are possible future additions for other RFCs.  (Please don't bikeshed them here; they are shown as an example of where pattern matching can extend to in the future.)

==== Range pattern ====

<code php>
$foo is 0..=10;

// Equivalent to:
$foo >=0 && $foo <= 10;

$foo is 0..<10;

// Equivalent to:
$foo >=0 && $foo < 10;

$foo is >10;

// Equivalent to:
$foo > 10;
</code>

==== Regex pattern ====

<code php>
$foo is /^http:\/\/$domain/

// Equivalent to:
$matches = [];
preg_match('/^http:\/\/$domain/', $foo, $matches);
$domain == $matches[0];
</code>

=== Array-application pattern===

One possible extension of patterns is the built-in ability to apply a pattern across an array.  While that could be done straightforwardly with a <php>foreach</php> loop over an array, it may be more performant if the entire logic could be pushed into engine-space.  One possible approach would look like this:

<code php>
$ints = [1, 2, 3, 4];
$someFloats = [1, 2, 3.14, 4];

$ints is array<int>; //True.  
$someFloats is array<int>; // False
$someFloats is array<int|float>; // True

// Equivalent to:
$result = true;
foreach ($ints as $v) {
  if (!is_int($v)) {
    $result = false;
    break;
  }
}
</code>

It is not yet clear if it would indeed be more performant than the user-space alternative, or how common that usage would be.  For that reason it has been left out of the RFC for now, but we mention it as a possible future extension.

==== Throwing alternative ====

There may be cases where the desired result is not a boolean but an error condition.  One possible way to address that would be with a second keyword, <php>as</php>, which behaves the same as <php>is</php> but throws an Error rather than returning false.

<PHP>

// This either evaluates to true and assigns $username and $password to the matching properties of Foo, OR it evaluates to false.
$foo is Foo { $username, $password };

// This either evaluates to true and assigns $username and $password to the matching properties of Foo, OR it throws an Error.
$foo as Foo { $username, $password };
</PHP>

Whither or not this alternative syntax would be useful in practice is unclear, so for now it is omitted.  It would be a reasonably straightforward addition in the future, however, if practical experience suggested it was useful.
