===== Introduction =====

This RFC introduces pattern matching syntax for PHP.  //[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching|Pattern Matching]]// as a language concept contains two parts: Matching a variable against a potentially complex data structure pattern, and optionally extracting values out of that variable into their own variables.  In a sense it serves a similar purpose for complex data structures as regular expressions do for strings.  When properly applied, it can lead to very compact but still readable code, especially when combined with conditional structures such as ''match()''.  It does not, however, nor is it intended to, represent every possible type of comparison that could be imagined: Just the most common, in a more compact and readable form.

Pattern matching is found in a number of languages, including Python, Haskell, C#, ML, Rust, and Swift, among others.  The syntax offered here draws inspiration from several of them, but is not a direct port of any.

This RFC is part of the [[rfc:adts|Algebraic Data Types Epic]].  It is a stepping stone toward full Algebraic Data Types (Enums with associated values) but stands on its own as useful functionality.

There are many components of this RFC, and many of them can be delayed for future follow-ons with relative ease.  However, some are also straightforward enough and useful enough that it seems wise to include them from the start, even if they logistically could be delayed.  The different patterns below have been grouped by their significance.  As of this time we're not yet sure which to include now and which to save for future scope, or to leave that to a secondary vote.  Feedback on that question is welcome.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC introduces a new keyword and binary operator: ''is''.  The ''is'' keyword indicates that its right hand side is a pattern against which its left hand side should be applied.  The ''is'' operator is technically a comparison operator, and always returns a boolean ''true'' or ''false''.

<code php>
if($var is <pattern>) {

}
</code>

The left-hand side of ''is'' will be evaluated first until it is reduced to a single value (which could be an arbitrarily complex object or array).  That value will then be compared to the pattern, and ''true'' or ''false'' returned.

While patterns may resemble other language constructs, whatever follows ''is'' is a pattern, not some other instruction.

''is'' may be used in any context in which a boolean result is permissible.  That includes variable assignment, ''if'' conditions, ''while'' conditions, ''match()'' expressions, etc.

==== Pattern structure ====

Patterns are a super-set of type definitions.  A pattern consists of one or more pattern segments, combined by <php>|</php> and <php>&</php> conjunctions.  If both are used, patterns must be in Disjunctive Normal Form (And ORed list of ANDs), and each segment must be enclosed in parentheses.  These are the same rules that apply to compound types already.

==== Core patterns ====

Core patterns are the patterns that are mandatory to include in this RFC.  They are either core syntax (without which nothing else works), or "base cases" that are not super interesting on their own but matter a great deal when combined either with each other or the more interesting patterns later.

=== Type pattern ===

A pattern may be a type signature, including both class and primitive types as well as compound types.  In this case, ''is'' will match the left hand side value against the specified type.  That is, the following are all legal:

<code php>
$foo is string;    // Equivalent to is_string($foo)
$foo is Request;   // Equivalent to $foo instanceof Request
$foo is ?array;    // Equivalent to is_array($foo) || is_null($foo)
$foo is float;     // Equivalent to is_int($foo) || is_float($foo), for consistency with types.

// These are compound patterns, consisting of two sub-patterns each.
$foo is int|float; // Equivalent to is_int($foo) || is_float($foo)
$foo is User|int;  // Equivalent to $foo instanceof User || is_int($foo)
$foo is string|Stringable; // Equivalent to is_string($foo) || $string instanceof Stringable

// This is also a compound pattern. It is equivalent to:
// $foo instanceof User || ($foo instanceof Account && $foo instanceof Authenticated)
$foo is User|(Account&Authenticated)
</code>

Type patterns are always evaluated in strict mode, so as to be consistent with <php>is_int()</php> and its siblings.

A type match may be any syntax supported by a parameter type; in a sense, ''$foo is pattern'' is equivalent to "would $foo pass a type check if passed to a parameter with this type specification in strict mode."  Should more complex type checks become allowed (such as type aliases, etc.) they will become valid in a pattern as well.  Note that, as shown in the 4th example above, an integer will pass a pattern match for type <php>float</php>.  That is consistent with how strict type declarations work today.

=== Literal pattern ===

Any literal may be a pattern.  When used on its own it is not particularly useful (it's equivalent to <php>===</php>), but can be used in a compound pattern to more complex effect.  It is also valuable when used with ''match()'' (see below).

<code php>
// Simple degenerate case patterns.
$foo is 5;         // Equivalent to $foo === 5
$foo is 'yay PHP'; // Equivalent to $foo === 'yay PHP'

// More practical compound example
$foo is "beep"|"boop"; // Equivalent to $foo === "beep" || $foo === "boop"
</code>

=== Built-in constants pattern ===

There are three constant values built-in that can be used directly: <php>true</php>, <php>false</php>, and <php>null</php>.  They function essentially the same as a literal pattern as far as the user is concerned, but for implementation reasons are handled slightly differently internally.  As with literal patterns, their use stand-alone is minimal but they are useful in compound patterns or ''match()'' expressions.

<code php>
// Simple degenerate case patterns.
$foo is true;      // Equivalent to $foo === true
$foo is null;      // Equivalent to $foo === null

// More practical compound examples
$foo is array|null; // Equivalent to is_array($foo) || $foo === null
$foo is "Aardvark"|"Bear"|null // Equivalent to $foo === "Aardvark" || $foo === "Bear" || $foo === null
</code>

=== Class constant pattern ===

Class constants may also be used as a pattern:

<PHP>
$foo is 'spade'|'heart'|self::Wild;
</PHP>

Global constants may not be used directly, as they cannot be differentiated from class names.  However, they may be used in expression patterns (see next section).

==== match() enhancement ====

Pattern matching is frequently used in conjunction with branching structures, in particular with enumerations.  To that end, this RFC also enhances the ''match()'' structure.  Specifically, if the ''is'' keyword is used in ''match()'' then ''match()'' will perform a pattern match rather than an identity comparison.

That is, this code:

<code php>
$result = match ($somevar) is {
    Foo => 'foo',
    Bar => 'bar',
    Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

is equivalent to the following:

<code php>
$result = match (true) {
    $somevar is Foo => 'foo',
    $somevar is Bar => 'bar',
    $somevar is Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

(See "Open Questions" below regarding the syntax for <php>match()</php> with patterns.)

==== Compound structure patterns ====

These are where pattern matching really shines.  They are more involved/complex, but have more "bang for the buck" than the basic patterns above.  Technically, object property and array patterns could exist without variable binding, but they would be substantially less useful without it.  As a practical matter, therefore, it should be treated as a prerequisite for the other two.

It would be possible to implement only one of object properties or arrays, though both are highly useful so our recommendation is to include all three parts of this section.

=== Object property pattern ===

A pattern may also define a class and matches against scope-accessible properties of that object.  Only a single class type may be used, but any number of properties may be matched.  The properties must be accessible in the scope in which the pattern executes.  That is, a pattern evaluated outside the class may only match against public properties; a pattern inside the class may match against public, private, or protected; a pattern in a child class may match against protected properties of its parent but not private; etc.

<code php>

class Point {
    public function __construct(
        public int $x, 
        public int $y, 
        public int $z,
    ) {}
}

$p = new Point(3, 4, 5);

$p is Point {x: 3};
// Equivalent to:
$p instanceof Point && $p->x === 3;

$p is Point {y: 37, x: 2,};
// Equivalent to:
$p instanceof Point && $p->y === 37 && $p->x === 2;

// A multi-segment pattern that includes an object pattern.
$p is Point {x: 2}|null
// Equivalent to:
$p instanceof Point && $p->x === 2 || $p === null;
</code>

Properties may be listed in any order, but must be named.  A trailing comma is permitted.

==== Variable binding ====

One of the prime uses of pattern matching is to extract a value from a larger structure, such as an object (or Enumeration/ADT, in the future).  This RFC supports such variable binding by specifying the variable to populate.  If the input variable matches the rest of the pattern, then the corresponding value will be extracted and assigned to a variable of that name in the current scope.  It will remain in scope as long as normal variable rules say it should.  Only local variables may be bound, that is, you cannot bind to a property of an object.

The entire pattern either succeeds or fails.  No variables will be bound unless the entire pattern matches.

In the currently supported patterns, it is only relevant for object and array pattern matching.  (See the next section for array examples.)

<code php>
class Point {
    public function __construct(
        public int $x, 
        public int $y, 
        public int $z,
    ) {}
}

$p = new Point(3, 4, 5);

if ($p is Point {x: 3, y: $y} ) {
    print "x is 3 and y is $y.";
}
// Equivalent to:
if ($p instanceof Point && $p->x === 3) {
    $y = $p->y;
    print "x is 3 and y is $y.";
}

if ($p is Point {z: $z, x: 3, y: $y} ) {
  print "x is 3 and y is $y and z is $z.";
}
// Equivalent to:
if ($p instanceof Point && $p->x === 3) {
    $y = $p->y;
    $z = $p->z;
    print "x is 3 and y is $y and z is $z.";
}
</code>

Variable binding is not compatible with an ORed compound pattern, as depending on the segment that matches the variable may or may not end up defined, and there's no reliable way to determine that other than <php>isset()</php>.  An ANDed compound pattern is permitted, however.

If the variable name to extract to is the same as the name of the property, then the property name may be omitted.  That is, the last example can be abbreviated as:

<code php>
if ($p is Point {$z, x: 3, $y} ) {
  print "x is 3 and y is $y and z is $z.";
}
</code>

Variable binding is especially useful in ''match()'' statements, where there is no simple logical equivalent that doesn't involve additional functions.

<code php>
$result = match ($p) is {
  // These will match only some Point objects, depending on their property values.
  Point{x: 3, y: 9, $z} => "x is 3, y is 9, z is $z",
  Point{$z, $x, y: 4} => "x is $x, y is 4, z is $z",
  Point{x: 5, $y} => "x is 5, y is $y, and z doesn't matter",
  // This will match any Point object.
  Point{$x, $y, $z} => "x is $x, y is $y, z is $z",
};
</code>

Note that in this case, the variables ''$x'', ''$y'', and ''$z'' may or may not be defined after the ''match()'' statement executes depending on which pattern was matched.

This last usage is especially important in the context of ADTs, where combining an ADT with a pattern-matching <php>match()</php> would allow for this:

<PHP>
// Example of what is possible with both pattern matching and ADTs,
// though they are separate RFCs so the exact syntax is subject to change.

enum Move {
    case TurnLeft;
    case TurnRight;
    case Forward(int $amount);
}

match ($move) is {
    Move::TurnLeft => $this->orientation--,
    Move::TurnRight => $this->orientation++,
    Move::Forward{$amount} => $this->distance += $amount,
};


enum Option {
    case None;
    case Some(mixed $val);
}

match ($maybe) is {
    Option::Some {$val} => compute_something($val),
    Option::None => 'default value',
}
</PHP>

We view this RFC as a prerequisite for ADTs being useful in practice.

==== Array structure pattern ====

Array patterns match elements of an array individually against a collection of values.  It has two variants, positional or associative.  That is, the pattern MUST be entirely positional, or must specify a key for every position.  (This is in contrast to array literals, which allow keys to be omitted at random to get an integer assigned.)  If an associative pattern is used, the order of keys is explicitly irrelevant.

By default, array matching is exhaustive.  That is, the arity of the array and pattern must match.  Alternatively, the pattern may include a <php>...</php> sequence as its last item to disable that arity checking, rendering any unspecified array keys explicitly irrelevant.

<code php>
// Given:
$list = [1, 3, 5, 7];

// Degenerate, not very useful case.
if ($list is [1, 3, 5, 7]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && count($list) === 4 
    && $list[0] === 1 
    && $list[1] === 3 
    && $list[2] === 5 
    && $list[3] === 7
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}


if ($list is [1, 3]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// False.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && count($list) === 2
    && $list[0] === 1 
    && $list[1] === 3
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($list is [1, 3, ...]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && array_key_exists($list, 0) && $list[0] === 1 
    && array_key_exists($list, 1) && $list[1] === 3
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($list is [1, 3, $third, 7]) {
  print "Yes: $third";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && count($list) === 4
    && $list[0] === 1 
    && $list[1] === 3
    && $list[3] === 7
    ) {
    $third = $list[2];
    print "Yes: $third";
}


if ($list is [1, 3, $third, ...]) {
  print "Yes: $third";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($list) 
    && array_key_exists($list, 0) && $list[0] === 1 
    && array_key_exists($list, 1) && $list[1] === 3
    && array_key_exists($list, 2)
    ) {
    $third = $list[2];
    print "Yes: $third";
}
</code>

<code php>
// Given:
$assoc = ['a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B'];

// Degenerate, not very useful case.
if ($assoc is ['a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B']) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 2 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'a') && $assoc['a'] === 'A'
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === 'B'
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($assoc is ['a' => 'A', 'b' => @($b)]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 2 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'a') && $assoc['a'] === 'A'
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === $b
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($assoc is ['a' => 'A', 'b' => $b]) {
  print "Yes: $b";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 2 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'a') && $assoc['a'] === 'A'
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b')
    ) {
    $b = $assoc['b'];
    print "Yes: $b";
}

if ($assoc is ['b' => 'B']) {
  print "Yes";
}
// False.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) 
    && count($assoc) === 1 
    && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === 'B'
    ) {
    print "Yes";
}

if ($assoc is ['b' => 'B', ...]) {
  print "Yes";
}
// True.  Equivalent to:
if (is_array($assoc) && array_key_exists($assoc, 'b') && $assoc['b'] === 'B') {
    print "Yes";
}
</code>

Of particular note, the pattern matching approach automatically handles <php>array_key_exists()</php> checking.  That means a missing array element will not trigger a warning, whereas with a traditional <php>if ($foo['bar'] === 'baz')</php> approach missing values must be accounted for by the developer manually.  That provides some benefit in even the degenerate case of just checking a selection of keys against literal values, as missing values are handled automatically.

==== Recommended patterns ====

The following patterns are nominally optional.  The RFC would have significant benefit if it stopped here.  However, all of the following features would significantly improve the experience and flexibility of patterns.  Our recommendation is to include them.

=== Limited expression pattern ===

The use of variables directly in a pattern is not supported, as it would conflict with variable binding.  However, they may be included by delineating them within <php>@()</php>.  This approach also works for global constants.  As with literals, they are useful mainly in compound patterns and <php>match()</php>.  (NOTE: We hate the <php>@()</php> syntax, too.  Alternative suggestions very welcome.  Please just consider the feature itself for the moment.)

<code php>
// Simple degenerate case patterns.
$foo is @($bar); // Equivalent to $foo === $bar
$foo is @(PHP_VERSION); // Equivalent to $foo === PHP_VERSION

// More practical compound expressions
$foo is @(Errors::$notFound)|@(Errors::$invalid); // Equivalent to $foo === Errors::$notFound || $foo === Errors::$invalid
</code>

It would be possible to expand this pattern to support arbitrary expressions within the delimiters, including function calls.  However, that has been omitted at this time in the interest of simplicity.  If a good use case for it can be shown in the future, that can be added in a backward compatible way, however.

=== Variable binding pattern matching ===

When binding to a variable, the <php>is</php> keyword may be nested.  In that case, the entire pattern must succeed or fail.  Values will be bound if and only if all binding patterns match as well.

For example:

<code php>
if ($foo is Foo{a: @($someA), $b is Point(x: 5, y: @($someY)) }) {
  print "x is 5, y is $someY, z is $b->z";
}
// Equivalent to:
if ($foo instanceof Foo
    && $foo->a === $someA
    && $bar instanceof Point
    && $bar->y = $someY
    ) {
    $b = $foo->b;
    print "x is 5, y is $someY, z is $b->z";
}
</code>

<code php>
if ($params is ['user' => $user is AuthenticatedUser{role: 'admin'}, ...]) {
    print "Congrats, $user->name, you can do admin things!"
}
// Equivalent to:
if (is_array($params)
    && array_key_exists($params, 'user')
    && $params['user'] instanceof AuthenticatedUser
    && $params['user']->role === 'admin'
    ) {
    $user = $params['user'];
    print "Congrats, $user->name, you can do admin things!"
}
</code>

(Note: Some languages use a different syntax than above for this behavior.  We are still investigating the ideal syntax to use.)

=== as keyword ===

In some cases, the desired result is not a boolean but an error condition.  One possible way to address that would be with a second keyword, <php>as</php>, which behaves the same as <php>is</php> but returns the matched value or throws an Error rather than returning false.

<PHP>

// This either evaluates to true and assigns $username and $password to the matching properties of Foo, OR it evaluates to false.
$foo is Foo { $username, $password };

// This either evaluates to true and assigns $username and $password to the matching properties of Foo, OR it throws an Error.
$foo as Foo { $username, $password };
</PHP>

This pattern could potentially be combined with the "weak mode flag" (see below) to offer object validation with embedded coercion.

==== Possible patterns ====

The following patterns are also reasonable to include, and offer notable benefits.  However, they are not a prerequisite for this RFC to be useful.  They may be included or not as the consensus dictates.  However, their design has been considered as part of this RFC to ensure consistent behavior.

==== Range pattern ====

Applicable to numeric variables, this pattern would validate that a value is within a given range.  Verifying that the value is numeric is implicitly included.

<code php>
$foo is 0..=10;

// Equivalent to:
$foo >=0 && $foo <= 10;

$foo is 0..<10;

// Equivalent to:
$foo >=0 && $foo < 10;

$foo is >10;

// Equivalent to:
$foo > 10;
</code>

==== Regex pattern ====

Applicable only to ''string'' (and possible ''Stringable''?) values.  This pattern validates that a value conforms to a provided regular expression, and potentially extracts values from it if appropriate.  (Extracted values would only be assigned if the pattern matches.)

<code php>
$foo is /^http:\/\/$domain/

// Equivalent to:
$matches = [];
preg_match('/^http:\/\/$domain/', $foo, $matches);
$domain == $matches[0];
</code>

==== Array-application pattern ====

One possible extension of patterns is the built-in ability to apply a pattern across an array.  While that could be done straightforwardly with a <php>foreach</php> loop over an array, it may be more performant if the entire logic could be pushed into engine-space.  One possible approach would look like this:

<code php>
$ints = [1, 2, 3, 4];
$someFloats = [1, 2, 3.14, 4];

$ints is array<int>; //True.  
$someFloats is array<int>; // False
$someFloats is array<int|float>; // True

// Equivalent to:
$result = true;
foreach ($ints as $v) {
  if (!is_int($v)) {
    $result = false;
    break;
  }
}
</code>

It is not yet clear if it would indeed be more performant than the user-space alternative, or how common that usage would be.  For that reason it has been left out of the RFC for now, but we mention it as a possible future extension.

=== "weak mode" flag ===

By default, pattern matching uses strict comparisons.  However, there are use cases where a weak comparison is more appropriate.  Setting a pattern or sub-pattern to weak-mode would permit standard PHP type coercion to determine if a value matches.

For example:

<code php>

$s = "5";

// Default, strict mode

$s is int; // False

// Opt-in weak mode

$s is ~int // True
</code>

This would be particularly useful in combination with an array application pattern, to verify that, for instance, all elements in an array are numeric.

<code php>
$a = [2, 4, "6", 8];

$a is array<int>; // False

$a is array<~int>; // True
</code>

It is possible that we could extend the ''as'' keyword here as well to save the coercion.  That is, if the value is weakly compatible, the ''as'' keyword would convert it safely (or throw if it cannot be).  That would allow validation across an object or array in a single operation.

For example:

<code php>
$a = [2, 4, "6", 8];

$a as array<~int>;

// $a is now [2, 4, 6, 8]

$b = [2, 4, 'six', 8];

$b as array<~int>; // Throws, because 'six' is not coerce-able to an integer.
</code>

We have not yet investigated how feasible this sort of coercion would be, but it is a potentially valuable feature.

=== Property guards ===

Something that became apparent during the development of property hooks is that a great many set hooks will be simple validation, often that a number is within a range or a string matches some criteria.  At present, those use cases are achievable with hooks but can be somewhat verbose.  Applying a pattern rule to a property would allow that rule to be applied on the set operation for that property, without having to implement it manually.

<code php>
class Test
{
    // These two properties have equivalent restrictions.
    public string $name is /\w{3,}/;

    public string $name { 
        set {
           if (!preg_match($value, '/\w{3,}/') {
               throw new \Exception();
           }
           $this->name = $value;
        }
    }
}
</code>

This more compact syntax would be considerably easier to read and maintain when used within a promoted constructor parameter, too.  Note that variable binding would not be supported in a property guard, as it makes little logical sense.

Elevating such checks to a pattern would also make the pattern more readily available to static analysis tools (IDEs or otherwise), which would then be better able to validate if a value is about to be passed to a parameter that would not satisfy the pattern (eg, because the string is too short).

(We're not sure if ''is'' or ''as'' would make more sense to use here.  That's an implementation detail we don't need to worry about until this feature is actually getting implemented.)

=== Parameter or return guards ===

In concept, parameters and returns could have a similar guard syntax to properties.  The use case is debatably smaller (maybe), but it would be reasonable to allow variable binding in this case.

As an example, the following would be equivalent.

<code php>
function test(string $name is /\w{3,}/): string is /\w{10,}/ {
    return $name . ' (retired)';
}

function test(string $name): string is /\w{10,}/ {
    $name as /\w{3,}/; // Throws if it doesn't match.

    $return = $name . ' (retired)';
    $return as /\w{10,}/; // Throws if it doesn't match.
    return $return;
}

</code>

Naturally type-only pattern checks are entirely redundant.  It would be most useful with regex or range patterns.  However, it would allow literal matches, which is a feature that has been requested in the past:

<code php>
function query(array $args, string $sort is 'ASC'|'DESC') { ... }
</code>

(This particular example is almost certainly better implemented as an enum, but it's a simple case to illustrate the concept.)

With variable binding, it would be possible to decompose an object or array as it is received.

<code php>
function test(Person $p is Person{$first, $last}) {
  var_dump($p); // Same as always.
  print $first; // This is the same value as $p->first
  print $last; // This is the same value as $p->last
}

// Equivalent to:
function test(Person $p) {
  $p as Person{$first, $last}; // Throws if it doesn't match. Binds variables if it does.
  
  var_dump($p); // Same as always.
  print $first; // This is the same value as $p->first
  print $last; // This is the same value as $p->last
}

==== Interaction with magic methods ====

When matching an object, it's possible to try to match against a property that is not defined, but the <php>__isset()</php> or <php>__get</php> magic methods are defined.  In that case:

  * If <php>__isset()</php> is triggered and returns false, it will never match anything.
  * If <php>__isset()</php> returns true or is not defined, then the return of invoking <php>__get()</php> will be used.  It will then be matched against the pattern the same as if it were a defined property value.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

A new keyword is added, ''is''.  That will conflict with any user-defined global constant named ''is''.

No other BC breaks are expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.next (aka 8.4).

===== RFC Impact =====

===== Open Issues =====

==== Include other patterns in the initial RFC? ====

Do any other patterns need to be included in the initial RFC?  Are there any listed in Future Scope that are must-have for the initial release?

==== Expression pattern syntax ====

The @() syntax for expression patterns is still an open question.  It needs some kind of delimeter to differentiate it from class names and binding variables, but the specific syntax we are flexible on.

==== match() "is" placement ====

The authors are split as to how the syntax for pattern matching <php>match()</php> should work.  There are two options:

<code php>
$result = match ($somevar) is {
    Foo => 'foo',
    Bar => 'bar',
    Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

<code php>
$result = match ($somevar) {
    is Foo => 'foo',
    is Bar => 'bar',
    is Baz|Beep => 'baz',
};
</code>

The former is shorter, and applies pattern matching to all arms.  The latter is more explicit, and would allow individual arms to be pattern matched or not depending on the presence of ''is''.  Of course, these options are not mutually exclusive and supporting both would be possible.  We are looking for feedback on this question.

===== Future Scope =====

Numerous other patterns can be supported in the future.  The following additional patterns are possible future additions for other RFCs.  (Please don't bikeshed them here; they are shown as an example of where pattern matching can extend to in the future.)

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

This is a simple up-or-down vote, requiring 2/3 Yes to pass.

===== Patches and Tests =====

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====

Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
