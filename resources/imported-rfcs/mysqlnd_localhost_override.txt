====== Add mysqlnd.localhost_override option ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-02-12
  * Author: Asbj√∏rn Sannes <asbjorn.sannes.at.interhost.no>
  * Status: In Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mysqlnd_localhost_override


===== Introduction =====

When "localhost" is set as the mysql host, the connection is set to connect to the specified socket. If no socket is set the hardcoded default of /tmp/mysql.sock is used.

I have noted the following:
  * many populare php applications put in localhost as the default, making it work out of the box for most installations.
  * many distributions patches the default of /tmp/mysql.sock today to match where their default MySQL installation puts their unix socket.
  * when splitting a webserver and mysql installation all the applications needs to be reconfigured to point at the external mysql server.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

I propose we introduce a new option called mysqlnd.localhost_override which enables a system administrator or php distributor to configure how localhost should be overriden.

https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/275

It keeps backward compatability by falling back to current behaviour if mysqlnd.localhost_override is not set.

If the old behaviour were to be deprecated or phased out, a default value of %%unix:///tmp/mysql.sock%% may be appropriate. It would also leave the behaviour of "localhost" easier to follow.

===== Documentation =====

If this extension of mysqlnd were to be accepted and merged, the documentation must be updated to include the new option and its syntax.

Example of usage:<file>
mysqlnd.localhost_override = unix:///var/run/mysql/mysqld.sock
mysqlnd.localhost_override = tcp://otherhost:3306
</file>
