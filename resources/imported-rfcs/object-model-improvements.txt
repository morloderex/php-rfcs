===== Introduction =====

The purpose of RFCs is to improve the current PHP5 object model.


==== Why do we need this ====

Actual PHP5 object model provides the basic for Object Oriented programming but it lacks for support for library or third parties developers.

==== New Features ====
 - Constructors
    * Provide a default empty constructor (if applicable)
    * Remove the inheritance
    * Disallow directly calls to them
    * Ensure constructor call on parent classes

 - Magic methods:
    * disallow directly call from outer context?
    * markers interfaces

 - class / interface
    * provide a magic constant with the fully qualified class name
      <code>
namespace Test { 
	class Bar {}
	var_dump( Bar::CLASS ); // string "Test\Bar"
}
      </code>
