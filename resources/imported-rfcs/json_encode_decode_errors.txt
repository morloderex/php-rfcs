====== PHP RFC: Raise warnings for json_encode() and json_decode() issues ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2017-07-28
  * Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
  * Proposed version: PHP 7.3
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

Whenever ''json_encode()'' or ''json_decode()'' are called, you //must// call ''json_last_error()'' to check if a failure occurred.

This is unnecessarily complicated and is easy to be forgotten leading to bugs in code. Particular with new developers that aren't familiar with error handling techniques.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes changing ''json_encode()'' and ''json_decode()'' to raise E_WARNING whenever a failure occurs.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Existing code that is using ''json_last_error()'' for error handling may need changing to handle the E_WARNING instead.

However it is expected that most code is either suppressing warnings, or converting them to exceptions with an exception handler.

It's also worth noting that ''json_decode()'' already has 2 instances it raises E_WARNING.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.3

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires 50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'.
