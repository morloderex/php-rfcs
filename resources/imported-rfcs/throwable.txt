====== PHP RFC: Introduce Throwable interface and Error class ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2015-03-15
  * Author: Sebastian Bergmann <sebastian@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/throwable

===== Introduction =====
PHP 7 [[rfc::engine_exceptions_for_php7|replaces existing fatal or recoverable fatal errors with exceptions]]. While the respective RFC was already in voting, I proposed a change to the exception hierarchy it used (see below).

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes the following changes to PHP 7's exception hierarchy:

* Introduce a <code>Throwable</code> interface
* Let <code>Exception</code> implement the <code>Throwable</code> interface
* Introduce an <code>Error</code> class that implements the <code>Throwable</code> interface
* Use <code>Error</code> class as base class for exceptions raised by the engine

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
<code>Error</code> and <code>Throwable</code> are no longer available as names in the global namespace.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== References =====
* [[rfc::engine_exceptions_for_php7|Exceptions in the engine]]
