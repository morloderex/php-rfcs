  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2015-03-15
  * Author: Sebastian Bergmann <sebastian@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/throwable

===== Introduction =====
PHP 7 [[rfc::engine_exceptions_for_php7|replaces existing fatal or recoverable fatal errors with exceptions]]. While the respective RFC was already in voting, I proposed a change to the exception hierarchy it used (see below).

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes the following changes to PHP 7's exception hierarchy:

  * Introduce a ''Throwable'' interface
  * Let ''Exception'' implement the ''Throwable'' interface
  * Remove ''BaseException''
  * Let ''EngineException'' implement the ''Throwable'' interface
  * Let ''ParseException'' extend the ''EngineException'' class

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
''Error'' and ''Throwable'' are no longer available as names in the global namespace.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== References =====
* [[rfc::engine_exceptions_for_php7|Exceptions in the engine]]
