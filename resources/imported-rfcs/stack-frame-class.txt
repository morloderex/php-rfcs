====== PHP RFC: StackFrame class ======

The ''debug_backtrace()'' function currently returns stack trace frames as an array of arrays with information about the file, line, class, type, object, args and function name as keys. This RFC proposes to add a ''debug_backtrace()'' alternative which returns an array of objects instead. This reduces memory usage and makes code operating on frames more readable.
