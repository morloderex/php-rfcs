====== PHP RFC: Stochastic Rounding Mode ======

===== Introduction =====
Rounding modes use some rule to determine in which direction a supplied value should be rounded. While all of the rounding modes available in PHP right now are deterministic, there are other ways that rounding can occur.

This RFC proposes adding a **stochastic rounding mode** that uses a weighted random process to determine the rounding direction.

===== Proposal =====
A **stochastic rounding mode** rounds with a probability that corresponds to the value being rounded. For instance:

<code php>
$val = stochastic_rounding_function(1.8);

echo $val; 
// 20% of the time, this will echo "1"
// 80% of the time, this will echo "2"
</code>

This mode ensures that if the same value is rounded many times, the average value of the rounded numbers will approach the original number. This is mainly used in linear algebra, particularly machine learning applications.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
Describe any new constants so they can be accurately and comprehensively explained in the PHP documentation.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This section details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
