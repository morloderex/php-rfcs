====== PHP RFC: Doxygen ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2017-05-30
  * Author: Richard Fussenegger, php@fleshgrinder.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/doxygen

===== Introduction =====
Proposal to adopt the [[http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/|Doxygen]] documentation style for the C sources of PHP

===== Proposal =====
  * https://github.com/jgmdev/phoxygen
  * https://www.mantidproject.org/Visual_Studio_Doxygen_Setup
  * https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JasonWilliams.AtomineerProDocumentationTrial

Doxygen supports multiple formats. However, only two are usable for us due to our requirement to be compatible with the C89 standard.

====== JavaDoc style ======
<code c>
/**
 * Attempts to open the given file for reading.
 *
 * @param[in] fname The full path name of the file to open.
 * @return NULL if an error occurs, or a handle for the file.
 */
</code>

A considerable advantage of the JavaDoc style is that it matches the style of PhpDoc a lot. This means that PHP users who want to contribute to internals have it easier to get accustomed with it.

====== Qt Style ======
<code c>
/*!
\brief Attempts to open the given file for reading.

\param[in] fname The full path name of the file to open.

\return NULL if an error occurs, or a handle for the file.
*/
</code>

===== Future Scope =====
Generating documentation and actually publishing it online for users to browse. We could publish them directly on GitHub (free hosting) or create a separate section within the official PHP website where they are accessible.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Simple 50%+1 majority vote.
