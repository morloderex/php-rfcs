====== PHP RFC: Slim POST data ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2013-11-19
  * Author: Michael Wallner <mike@php.net>
  * Status: Thought it's done already
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/slim_post_data

===== Introduction =====

This is not a new feature per-se.

It is a memory usage improvement regarding receiving HTTP payloads with a potential reduction of 200-300%.

===== Proposal =====

This change replaces the SAPI layer's (raw_)post_data entries with a temporary PHP stream. 

If the request was a standard www-form-urlencoded or form-data POST, everything is just as it was before. 

If the request had another request method or an unrecognized content type, the payload is available through the re-usable, just-in-time %%php://input%% stream.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA and always_populate_raw_post_data were removed.

BC can be restored with:

<code php>
$GLOBALS["HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA"] = file_get_contents("php://input");
</code>

However, always_populate_raw_post_data may be re-introduced again to mitigate part of this BC issue. It could even be made PHP_INI_USER to further minimize the impact, but I guess it makes no difference if one has to call ini_set or file_get_contents...

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next 5.x, i.e. 5.6

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

Web-SAPIs.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

Extensions utilizing %%SG(request_info).(raw_)post_data(_len)%%.

In case of mbstring, the fix was as simple and ineffective as:
<code diff>
@@ -376,7 +377,10 @@ SAPI_POST_HANDLER_FUNC(php_mb_post_handler)
        info.num_from_encodings     = MBSTRG(http_input_list_size); 
        info.from_language          = MBSTRG(language);
 
-       detected = _php_mb_encoding_handler_ex(&info, arg, SG(request_info).post_data TSRMLS_CC);
+       php_stream_rewind(SG(request_info).request_body);
+       php_stream_copy_to_mem(SG(request_info).request_body, &post_data_str, PHP_STREAM_COPY_ALL, 0);
+       detected = _php_mb_encoding_handler_ex(&info, arg, post_data_str TSRMLS_CC);
+       STR_FREE(post_data_str);
</code>

===== Open Issues =====

  * Reintroduce always_populate_raw_post_data?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Standard form POSTs and file uploads.

===== Future Scope =====

The SAPI layer might be improved for SAPIs to provide their own PHP stream for POST data implementation, instead of soaking everything into the temp stream.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * Yes, leave it as is.
  * Yes, but re-introduce always_populate_raw_post_data.
  * No, go away.

===== Patches and Tests =====

More or less:
