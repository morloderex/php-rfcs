===== Introduction =====

This RFC introduces 3 enhancements to the PHP `sleep()` function, aimed at increasing its flexibility, precision, and cross-platform consistency.

1/3: **Enhancement of Precision**: The first proposal seeks to  extend the PHP `sleep()` function to accept both integers and floats, enabling delays with sub-second precision.


2/3: **Normalized Return Values on Windows**: Make sleep's return value consistent across operating systems (specifically Windows)

3/3: **Enhanced Return Value Precision**: This RFC proposes to refine the return value of `sleep()` to include sub-second precision.


===== Proposal =====

The proposed changes are designed to make `sleep()` more versatile, precise, and consistent across different operating systems.

1/3: **Acceptance of Float Arguments for Sub-Second Precision**: The core of this proposal is to extend the `sleep()` function to accept both integers and floats as arguments. This modification will enable developers to specify sleep durations with sub-second precision, a feature currently unavailable with the integer-only parameter. By adopting float values, `sleep()` will become a more powerful tool for precise timing operations, eliminating the need to resort to the more complex `usleep()` and `time_nanosleep()` functions for finer-grained delays. This change will maintain the simplicity and ease of use of `sleep()`, while expanding its functionality.

2/3: **Normalized Return Values on Windows**: Presently, when a `sleep()` operation is interrupted on Windows, it returns a static value of 192, reflecting the WAIT_IO_COMPLETION constant from the Windows API. This behavior diverges from that on other platforms, where `sleep()` returns the number of seconds left if interrupted. To address this inconsistency, we propose to standardize the return value of `sleep()` across all platforms by making it return the number of seconds remaining, even on Windows. This adjustment will enhance the portability of PHP scripts and ensure consistent behavior of the `sleep()` function in cross-platform development.

3/3: **Return Value Precision Enhancement**: The current implementation of `sleep()` returns the number of seconds remaining upon interruption with an integer precision. This proposal seeks to improve the precision of the return value to include fractions of a second. Enhancing the return value precision will allow developers to have a more accurate understanding of the timing and duration of interruptions.

These proposed enhancements are intended to bolster the `sleep()` function's capability. By increasing precision, ensuring consistency across platforms, and maintaining simplicity, we aim to significantly improve the utility of `sleep()`.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Minimal impact is expected on existing codebases. However, there are specific areas where changes in behavior should be noted:

1/3: **Handling of Float Arguments**: The extension of `sleep()` to accept float arguments represents a change from its current integer-only input. Previously, under `strict_types=0`, passing a float to `sleep()` would result in an E_DEPRECATED warning due to the implicit conversion of the float to an integer, causing a loss of precision and initiating a sleep for the truncated integer value. Under `strict_types=1`, passing a float would lead to a TypeError, as `sleep()` strictly expected an integer. With the proposed changes, `sleep()` will accept float values directly, enabling precise sleep durations without generating warnings or errors. This modification enhances the function's usability without disrupting existing integer-based usage.

2/3: **Windows Platform Behavior**: The current return value of 192 on Windows when `sleep()` is interrupted (reflecting the WAIT_IO_COMPLETION constant) will be changed to return the actual number of seconds remaining, aligning with the behavior on other platforms. This change ensures consistency across operating systems but alters the specific return value Windows developers might have previously expected in their interrupt handling logic.

3/3: **Return Value Precision**: Enhancing the return value precision of `sleep()` to include fractions of a second (when the sleep is interrupted) modifies the current behavior, which returns an integer. While this change provides more detailed information, it may affect existing code that expects an integer return value.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

To accommodate the potential impact and preferences regarding the implementation timeline of the proposed enhancements to the `sleep()` function, voting will be structured into six separate choices. This expanded voting framework allows contributors to express their support or opposition to each enhancement both in the context of the next minor version of PHP and for inclusion in PHP 9, the next major version. This approach ensures a nuanced evaluation of each proposal's merits, based on its immediate and long-term benefits to the PHP language.

The six voting choices are outlined as follows:

1. **Acceptance of Float Arguments for Sub-Second Precision in PHP's Next Minor Version**:
   - **Yes**: Support extending the `sleep()` function to accept both integers and floats, enabling delays with sub-second precision, for the next minor version of PHP.
   - **No**: Oppose this change for the next minor version.

2. **Acceptance of Float Arguments for Sub-Second Precision in PHP 9**:
   - **Yes**: Support extending the `sleep()` function to accept both integers and floats, enabling delays with sub-second precision, for PHP 9.
   - **No**: Oppose this change for PHP 9.

3. **Normalized Return Values on Windows in PHP's Next Minor Version**:
   - **Yes**: Support modifying `sleep()` on Windows to return the number of seconds remaining upon interruption for the next minor version of PHP.
   - **No**: Oppose this change for the next minor version.

4. **Normalized Return Values on Windows in PHP 9**:
   - **Yes**: Support modifying `sleep()` on Windows to return the number of seconds remaining upon interruption for PHP 9.
   - **No**: Oppose this change for PHP 9.

5. **Return Value Precision Enhancement in PHP's Next Minor Version**:
   - **Yes**: Support enhancing the precision of the `sleep()` function's return value to include fractions of a second when sleep is interrupted for the next minor version of PHP.
   - **No**: Oppose this change for the next minor version.

6. **Return Value Precision Enhancement in PHP 9**:
   - **Yes**: Support enhancing the precision of the `sleep()` function's return value to include fractions of a second when sleep is interrupted for PHP 9.
   - **No**: Oppose this change for PHP 9.

Each vote will be considered independently, allowing for a detailed and specific understanding of the community's preferences regarding the timing and scope of these enhancements.
