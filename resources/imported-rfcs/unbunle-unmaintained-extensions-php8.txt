  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-07-15
  * Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbunle-unmaintained-extensions-php8

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to unbundle the listed extension in PHP 8 following the [[rfc:umaintained_extensions|Cleaning up unmaintained extensions RFC]].

Information about extension maintenance status is based on the EXTENSIONS file((https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/EXTENSIONS|)) located at the root of php-src.

The following list provides a short overview of the extensions targeted for unbundling, while a more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * The CGI SAPI
  * The DBA extension
  * The ODBC database extension
  * The PDO ODBC extension
  * The PDO Firebird extension
  * The XML-RPC extension
  * The Enchant extension
  * The GetText extension
  * The Pspell extension
  * The PCNTL (Process control) extension
  * The POSIX extension
  * The Shared Memory (shmop) extension
  * The System V Semaphore extensions (which contains sysvem, sysvsh, and sysvmsg)
  * The bzip2 (bz2) extension
  * The COM .Net extension
  * The FTP extension
  * The SNMP extension
  * The Readline extension

===== Proposal =====

Each extension unbundling proposal is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority.

=== The CGI SAPI ===

This SAPI never had a named maintainer. Moreover, FastCGI support exists via the PHP-FPM SAPI.

=== The ODBC extension ===

This extension hasn't had a maintainer since 2004.

=== The PDO ODBC driver extension ===

This extension never had a named maintainer.

=== The PDO Firebird driver extension ===

This extension hasn't had a maintainer since 2007.

==== XML Extensions ====
=== The XML-RPC extension ===

This extension has been orphaned and thus should not be used.

==== Human Language and Character Encoding Support ====
=== The Enchant extension ===

This extension never had a named maintainer.

=== The GetText extension ===

This extension never had a named maintainer.

=== The Pspell extension ===

This extension never had a named maintainer.

==== Other extensions ====
=== The bzip2 (bz2) extension ===

=== The SNMP extension ===

This extension hasn't had a maintainer since 2013.\\
There are currently 4 open/analyzed/assigned bugs for this extension on the bug tracker.

=== The Readline extension ===

This extension never had a named maintainer.\\
There are currently 6 open/analyzed/assigned bugs for this extension on the bug tracker.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Code using these extensions will need to install the corresponding extension via PECL or port them to a better-maintained extension.
