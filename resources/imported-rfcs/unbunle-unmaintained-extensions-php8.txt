     * The MySQL extension
     * The MySQL PDO Driver extension
     * The PostgreSQL (pgsql) extension
     * The PostgreSQL PDO Driver extension
     * The SQLite PDO Driver extension
     * The ODBC database extension
     * The ODBC PDO Driver extension
     * The Firebird PDO Driver extension

  * XML extensions
     * The XML-RPC extension
     * The DOM extension
     * The SimpleXML extension
     * The XML Parser (xml) extension
     * The libxml extension
     * The XML Reader extension
     * The XML Writer extension
     * The XSL extension
  * The Enchant extension
  * The GetText extension
  * The Pspell extension
  * The PCNTL (Process control) extension
  * The POSIX extension
  * The Shared Memory (shmop) extension
  * The System V Semaphore extensions (which contains sysvem, sysvsh, and sysvmsg)
  * The bzip2 (bz2) extension
  * The COM .Net extension
  * The FTP extension
  * The SNMP extension
  * The Readline extension
