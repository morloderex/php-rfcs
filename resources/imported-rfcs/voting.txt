====== Request for Comments: Voting on PHP features ======

===== Introduction =====

This document describes the procedure to propose an idea for adoption by the PHP community and decide if the community accepts or rejects the idea.

===== Proposal initiation =====

Proposal is formally initiated by creating an RFC on PHP wiki and announcing it on the list. If the proposal is a repeated discussion of an existing RFC, with or without modification, it still should be announced on the list for discussion. 

The announcement will be done in a way that's easy to flag & follow, e.g. - by **[RFC]** in the subject line followed by the title of the RFC.

The proposal should be initiated by one of its authors. If the proposal is a repeated one, re-proposed by somebody else, the proposer should discuss with the original author, if possible, and add himself to the RFC author list before proposing it.

If the proposer is not a member of php.net and thus can not create RFCs on the wiki, he should recruit one of the members for help or request membership. 

===== Discussion period =====

There'd be a minimum amount of time between when an RFC is brought up on this list and when it's voted on - currently proposed period is 2 weeks.  The effective date will not be when the RFC was published on wiki.php.net/rfc - but when it was announced on internals@, by the author, with the intention of voting on it. This period can be extended when circumstances warrant it - such as major conferences, key people being busy, force majeure events - but should never be less than minimal time. 

This does not preclude discussion on the merits on any idea or proposal on the list without formally submitting it as a proposal, but the discussion time is counted only since the formal discussion announcement as described above. 

===== Voting =====

The author decides when it's time to move ahead and call a vote on the RFC.  If the author feels that there's still healthy discussion going on, he can decide not to move ahead to request a vote after the minimal period, but extend it as needed.  On the other hand, if he feels that the discussion is being derailed - he can always move ahead to a vote as long as the minimum discussion time elapsed.

The vote is announced on the mailing list in a separate thread by sending an email with the subject **[VOTE]**. It should reference the RFCs being voted on and if there are different options discussed, explain these options. It should also contain the URL of the page where the vote is taking place. 

The voting has minimal period of 1 week, which can be extended when circumstances warrant it.
