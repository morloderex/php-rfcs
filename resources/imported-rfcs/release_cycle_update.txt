===== Introduction =====
The current release cycle has been introduced in 2010 by [[rfc:releaseprocess|release process RFC]]. This has been working mostly well but there has been some reasonable requests for some minor changes over the time. The length of cycle is often mentioned as being too short. It is also quite risky introduce more complex fixes later in the cycle as the security supports does not allow fixing potential regressions. In addition it is not exactly clear which features can be introduced during beta, RC and bug fixing releases.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes following changes to the release cycle

==== Extending security support by one year ====

This is a straight forward change that will extend release cycle to 4 years - 2 years or bug fixes + 2 years of security fixes. The idea is that it will give users longer support with relatively small effort as it doesn't give that much load to RM's - security releases are not that often and are relatively easy.

The proposal does not include  updating of ABI incompatible versions of dependent libraries provided for Windows builds as this can add significantly more load so this is excluded. It means that Windows users should track security changes in dependant libraries if they want to keep using PHP in its second security year support. Preference should be update though. This is just for Windows as we don't build libraries for Linux and other systems - this is usually distribution job.

==== Allowing recent regression fixes during security support ====

This proposal is to allow fixes of regressions caused by other fixes introduced in the last 12 months. The reasoning behind this is that more complex fixes will be possible late in the cycle. Those fixes might introduce regression. If such regression is found in a year, then it will be possible to apply fix for that even if the branch allows only security fixes.

==== Disallowing new features completely in RC and bug fixing release ====

Currently there is an exception that states following: 
Bugfixes only (with a room for exceptions on a case by case basis and only for small self contained features additions). This is often source of confusion because no one can really decide what such feature can be. One usual feature is often constant addition. The problem with that is that it creates sort of precedent for other features. 

This proposes to drop this completely and disallow any feature addition in RC and bug fixing releases.

==== Allow feature that do not require RFC in beta ====

We allow RFC to be implemented during beta so other features should be allowed too.

==== Reduce number of RC to 4 ====

The release cycle is too long so this reduces number of RC's by 2.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
The changes will apply immediately on the all currently supported branches. It has been agreed between release managers that the additional security support will be possible to already apply on PHP-8.0. It means that PHP-8.0 will get extra year of security fixes.
