====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 8.0 ======
  * Date: 2019-07-23
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>, George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.0 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * ''date_sunrise()'' and ''date_sunset()''
  * ''DateTimeInterface::ISO8601''/''DATE_ISO8601''
  * ''get_browser''

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.0 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== date_sunrise() and date_sunset() ====

In favor of ''date_sun_info()''. Ini settings ''date.default_latitude'' and ''date.default_longitude'' will also be removed once the functions are gone. See https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4423.

====  DateTimeInterface::ISO8601/DATE_ISO8601 ====
This format is misleading as per the documentation it is actually not compatible with ISO-8601 and ''DateTime::ATOM''/''DATE_ATOM'' should be used instead.


==== get_browser() ====

This function is part of the standard library but requires an external dependency (browscap.ini) to work.
Moreover, userland implementations are faster than this function. (See user note 122181: http://docs.php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php#122181)

nikic: I disagree.

==== key(), current(), next(), prev(), reset() on objects ====

==== Accessing static members on traits ====

==== Optional param after required ====

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.0 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 9.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.
