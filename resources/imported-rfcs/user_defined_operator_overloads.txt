  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====
Operator overloading in PHP is currently supported within the engine for C code, and has well engineered designs built into the structures for objects and classes to facilitate it. These structures are currently unavailable outside of extensions or core, and this RFC aims to provide that feature to PHP developers directly for a defined set of operators.

PHP allows classes written in C to implement operator overloading. This is already used in the DateTime library for easy comparison of DateTime objects:

<code php>
function checkDateIsOverOneHourInFuture(DateTimeInterface $date)
{
    $one_hour_in_future = new DateTime("+1 hour");

    if ($date <= $one_hour_in_future) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
</code>

Operator overloading is currently used by GMP to allow easier to read code. These two pieces of code are equivalent:

<code php>
// without operator overloading
$result = gmp_mod(
    gmp_add(
        gmp_mul($c0, gmp_mul($ms0, gmp_invert($ms0, $n0))),
        gmp_add(
            gmp_mul($c1, gmp_mul($ms1, gmp_invert($ms1, $n1))),
            gmp_mul($c2, gmp_mul($ms2, gmp_invert($ms2, $n2)))
        )
    ),
    gmp_mul($n0, gmp_mul($n1, $n2))
);
</code>

<code php>
// with operator overloading
$result = (
    $c0 * $ms0 * gmp_invert($ms0, $n0)
  + $c1 * $ms1 * gmp_invert($ms1, $n1)
  + $c2 * $ms2 * gmp_invert($ms2, $n2)
) % ($n0 * $n1 * $n2);
</code>

Even without understanding what the above code does (it's an excerpt from a Coppersmith attack on RSA), it should be obvious that the second code is a lot clearer. It makes the structure of the code immediately clear (three multiplications are summed up and the modulus is taken), whereas the function-based code actively hides any structure in the code. For mathematical operations infix notation just comes a lot more naturally.


===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes allowing classes written in PHP (aka userland) to implement operator overloading, for a limited set of operators, similar to how it is allowed for classes written in C.

==== New 'operator' Keyword ====

This RFC uses a new keyword ''operator'' instead of using ''function'' with something like magic methods. This keyword is only valid inside of a class definition, and will result in a parser error otherwise. Internally, the function pointers are stored on the class entry as magic methods, however using a different keyword has multiple advantages:

=== Allows Use Of Symbols As Names ===

Updating functions to allow symbols as function names could be done, however it would be difficult with the ''function'' keyword to allow it for operator overloads without allowing it in any arbitrary function. Further, supporting the "bitwise and" operator (&) would be particularly difficult and inefficient, as the parser would need to disambiguate whether this was intended as the function name or to mark the function as returning by-reference.

=== Specific Control Over Method Modifiers ===

Operator implementations all share the same set of restrictions on method modifiers, such as visibility or marking them as static. Using a different keyword makes it less confusing to PHP developers that these particular method implementations have specific restrictions on which modifiers can be used. It also allows future changes to the method modifiers for operators independently of class methods.

For example, suppose in the future it was desired to allow operators to be "greedy" and fire their implementation first from the left or right operand, instead of the left operand always having precedence. We could add a ''greedy'' modifier that only affects operators and is not available for functions.

<code php>
class Number {
    public greedy operator +(Number $other, bool $left): Number {}
}
</code>

This is given as an easy to understand example, not intended future scope.

=== Visually Separated For PHP Developers ===

The method implementations for operator overloads will change the behavior of the class as it interacts with the engine. Separating these visually with a different keyword makes it easier for developers to see visually how an object will behave.

=== Does Not Restrict Future Operators ===

Though it is not part of this RFC, one of the considerations made was whether this implementation would restrict future scope of operator overloads. This RFC allows for a defined set of operators, but it could be possible in the future that support for arbitrary infixes is desired. In such a situation, using magic methods would not be desired, as any combination of symbols may be used for the new infix. The restrictions on function names, such as needing to reserve the & to mark a function as being by-reference, would place limitations on such future scope.

This is avoided by allowing the restrictions on operator names to be separated from the restrictions on function names.

=== Does Not Name Operators ===

While the common names of the operators are consistent with math for real numbers, the same operators may not have the same name or even the same meaning in different domains. Using * will mean 'multiplication' in many contexts, but there are domains such as linear algebra where this may not be a 'mul' operation at all.

By representing the implementations by the symbols themselves, this RFC avoids forcing implementations to be mislabeled with words or names which do not match the semantic meaning of that symbol in the program context.

==== Add Support For Operators ====

For most operators, the methods have the form ''operator op($other, bool $left)'' and so an implementation to support the multiply (*) operator might look like:

<code php>
class ComplexNumber {
    public function __construct(public float $realPart, public float $imaginaryPart) {}
    
    public operator *(int|float|ComplexNumber $other, bool $left): ComplexNumber
    {
        if ($other instanceof ComplexNumber) {
            $newRealPart = ($this->realPart * $other->realPart) 
                + ($this->imaginaryPart * $other->imaginaryPart * -1);
            $newImaginaryPart = ($this->realPart * $other->imaginaryPart) 
                + ($this->imaginaryPart * $other->realPart);
        } else {
            $newRealPart = $this->realPart * $other;
            $newImaginaryPart = $this->imaginaryPart * $other;
        }
        
        return new ComplexNumber($newRealPart, $newImaginaryPart);
    }
}

$cnum1 = new ComplexNumber(1, 2);
$cnum2 = new ComplexNumber(3, 4);

$cnum3 = $cnum1 * $cnum2;

echo $cnum3->realPart.' + '.$cnum3->imaginaryPart.'i'; 
// Prints: -5 + 10i
</code>

==== Operator Order and Retrying ====

If the left operand doesn't support the operation (i.e. it doesn't implement the relevant operator method) then the engine will retry the operation using the right operand.

<code php>
<?php

class Number {
    function __construct(int $value) {}

    operator +(Number|int $other, bool $left): Number
    {
        if (is_int($other)) {
            return new Number($this->value + $other);
        } else {
            return new Number($this->value + $other->value);
        }
    }
}

$num = new Number(5);

$val1 = $num + 1;
// this is equivalent to
// $val1 = $num->'+'(1, true);

$val2 = 1 + $num;
// this is equivalent to
// $val2 = $num->'+'(1, false);
</code>

If the called object is the left operand, then $left is true. If the called object is the right operand, then $left is false.

<code php>
class Number {
    public __construct(readonly public float $value) {}
    
    public operator /(int|float $other, bool $left): Number 
    {
        if ($left) {
            $numerator = $this->value;
            $denominator = $other;
        } else {
            $numerator = $other;
            $denominator = $this->value;
        }
        
        if ($denominator == 0) {
            throw new Exception("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
        
        return new Number($numerator / $denominator);
    }
}
</code>

==== Operators Supported ====

This RFC proposes only a subset of the operators in PHP be supported for operator overloading. See also the sections below on the excluded logic and equality operators, and the implied operators.

The list of supported operations and their signatures are:

^ Operator ^ Signature ^
| ''+'' | ''%%operator +($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''-'' | ''%%operator -($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''*'' | ''%%operator *($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''/'' | ''%%operator /($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''%'' | ''%%operator %($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''%%**%%'' | ''%%operator **($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''&'' | ''%%operator &($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''%%|%%'' | ''%%operator |($other, bool $left): mixed)%%'' |
| ''^'' | ''%%operator ^($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''~'' | ''%%operator ~(): mixed%%'' |
| ''<<'' | ''%%operator <<($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''>>'' | ''%%operator >>($other, bool $left): mixed%%'' |
| ''=='' | ''%%operator ==($other): bool%%'' |
| ''<=>'' | ''%%operator <=>($other): int%%'' |

The magic methods can be implemented with parameter and return types to narrow the type accepted e.g.

<code php>
class BigNumber {
    readonly public string $value;

    public function __construct(int|float|string $value)
    {
        if (is_numeric($value)) {
            $this->value = (string)$value;
        } else {
            throw new Exception("Only initialize BigNumber with numeric values");
        }
    }
    
    public operator +(int|float|string|BigNumber $other, bool $left): self
    {
        if ($other instanceof BigNumber) {
            $otherVal = $other->value;
        } elseif (is_numeric($other)) {
            $otherVal = (string)$other;
        } else {
            throw new InvalidOperator("Only add BigNumber to numeric strings");
        }
        
        return new BigNumber(bc_add($this->value, $otherVal));
    }
}
</code>

==== Implied Operators ====

Many expressions in PHP can be reduced to simpler forms.

^ Operator ^ Implied As ^
| ''%%$a += $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a + $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a -= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a - $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a *= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a * $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a /= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a / $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a %= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a % $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a **= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a ** $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a &= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a & $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a |= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a | $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a ^= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a ^ $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a <<= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a << $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a >>= $b%%'' | ''%%$a = $a >> $b%%'' |
| ''%%$a != $b%%'' | ''%%!($a == $b)%%'' |
| ''%%$a < $b%%'' | ''%%($a <=> $b) == -1%%'' |
| ''%%$a <= $b%%'' | ''%%($a <=> $b) < 1%%'' |
| ''%%$a > $b%%'' | ''%%($a <=> $b) == 1%%'' |
| ''%%$a >= $b%%'' | ''%%($a <=> $b) > -1%%'' |
| ''%%++$a%%'' | ''%%$a = $a + 1%%'' |
| ''%%$a++%%'' | ''%%$a = $a + 1%%'' |
| ''%%--$a%%'' | ''%%$a = $a - 1%%'' |
| ''%%$a--%%'' | ''%%$a = $a - 1%%'' |
| ''%%-$a%%'' | ''%%$a = -1 * $a%%'' |

All those expressions that are reduced to implied forms will work, but don't have individual operator overloads. This ensures consistency with the expected behavior of the various operators and reduces backwards compatibility concerns.

==== Notable Operators ====

Most of the operators follow the form ''operator op($other, bool $left): mixed'' and those all behave in the same way. There are a few operators that will have a different signature, and/or behave differently.

=== Bitwise Not Operator (~) ===

The bitwise not operator is unary (acts on a single operand) and so has the signature ''operator ~(): mixed'' expecting no parameters.

=== Equals Operator (==) ===

Because comparisons have a reflection relationship instead of a commutative one, the $left argument is omitted as it could only be used for evil (making ''$obj == 5'' have a different result than ''5 == $obj'').

Comparison operators do not throw the ''InvalidOperatorError'' when unimplemented. Instead, the PHP engine falls back to existing comparison logic in the absence of an override for a given class.

The signature for the equals operator has the additional restriction of returning ''bool'' instead of ''mixed''.

=== Comparison Operator (<=>) ===

The comparison operator requires an ''int'' return rather than ''mixed'':

<code php>
operator <=>(mixed $other): int
</code>

Any return value larger than 0 will be normalized to 1, and any return value smaller than 0 will be normalized to -1.

The $left argument is omitted as it could only be used for evil e.g. implementing different comparison logic depending on which side its on. Instead of passing $left the engine will multiply the result of the call by (-1) where appropriate:

<code php>
class Number
{
    function __construct(readonly int $value) {}

    operator <=>(Number|int $other): int
    {
        if ($other instanceof Number) {
            return $this->value <=> $other->value;
        }

        return $this->value <=> $other;
    }
}

$obj = new Number(5);

$less_than = ($obj < 5);
// is equivalent to
// $less_than = ($obj->'<=>'(5) === -1);

$greater_than = 5 > $obj;
// is equivalent to
// $greater_than = ( ($obj->'<=>'(5) * - 1) === -1 );
</code>

By doing * -1, no matter what the implementation is from the PHP code, the >, >=, ==, <=, < comparisons are all guaranteed to be consistent regardless of whether the operand is on the left or right side. This avoids situations where both $obj1 > 5 and 5 > $obj1 can return true.

Comparison operators do not throw the ''InvalidOperatorError'' when unimplemented. Instead, the PHP engine falls back to existing comparison logic in the absence of an override for a given class.

This means that if the equals operator is unimplemented but comparison operator is implemented, the expression ''$obj == 6'' would be evaluated as ''$obj <=> 6 === 0''. 

Because of this, the comparison operator by itself can provide support for all inequality and equality comparisons if the values of the object support that kind of logic. For example, a Number class that represents an arbitrary precision real number could safely implement only the comparison operator.

However, objects which can be equal to another value but which cannot be compared for sorting/ordering could implement only the equals operator. Examples of objects such as this would be ones that represent complex numbers, or objects which represent non-numeric values such as collections.

==== Add InvalidOperatorError ====

A new throwable, ''InvalidOperatorError'', which extends ''TypeError'' is provided. This error is thrown when no operator overload can be found for an object which is used with one of the operators supported by this RFC.

<code php>
$obj = new stdClass();
$value = $obj + 3;

// Uncaught InvalidOperatorError: Operator '+' unsupported by class stdClass
</code>

Currently, this throws a TypeError.

==== Typed Parameters ====

The definitions for operators are required to explicitly type their parameters. That is, **an omitted type is not assumed to be mixed**. This is done because nearly every legitimate use of this feature would have a limitation about which types the operation can be combined with. As the engine cannot know what these limitations are, the PHP developer must provide the list of accepted types as part of the signature. This helps PHP developers avoid errors that may be deferred or difficult to track down.

<code php>
class Matrix {
    operator +($other, bool $left): Matrix {}
}

// Fatal Error: Matrix::+(): Parameter #1 ($other) must explicitly define a type
</code>

The ''mixed'' type can still be used for the ''$other'' parameter, but it must do so by explicitly typing it as such.

===== FAQ =====

==== Won't operator overloading be misused? ====

Yes.

It is a common pattern when developers (particularly juniors who have not learnt an appropriate level of fear yet) learn about a new feature, they will use it in ways that more senior/experienced developers would consider as 'bad'.

Most of the argument against operator overloading (https://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/03/operator-overloading-ad-absurdum.html) boils down to:

<blockquote>The problem is abuse. Somebody will name something '+' when it has nothing to do with the common notion of '+'. The resulting confusion is a bigger downside than the benefits of allowing programmers to be flexible in naming.</blockquote>

But this is true of any feature in PHP. People are free to write 'getter' methods that mutate an object state rather than just returning a value.

For all valid names X that evoke a common conception, somebody will name something 'X' when it has nothing to do with the common notion of 'X'.

Language design shouldn't focus on preventing people from doing things you disagree with, at the expense of blocking appropriate usage of a feature.

==== When will $left be useful? ====

Not all operators are commutative. The most trivial example of this is with subtraction:

<code php>
class Number {
    public function __construct(readonly public int|float $value) {}
    
    public operator -(int|float $other, bool $left): Number
    {
        if ($left) {
            return new Number($this->value - $other);
        } else {
            return new Number($other - $this->value);
        }
    }
}
</code>

However, there are more complicated examples with some possible usages. For example, with matrix multiplication:

<code php>
class Matrix {
    public function __construct(readonly public array $value) {}
    
    public operator *(Matrix $other, bool $left): Number
    {
        if ($left) {
            // Count of my columns needs to match
            // count of $other rows
        } else {
            // Count of my rows needs to match
            // count of $other columns
        }
    }
}
</code>

==== Why not interfaces? ====

Interfaces wouldn't help write correct code.

For example, a Vector2d and a Money class could both implement an ''Addable'' interface, but using ''Addable'' as a type check wouldn't prevent users from attempting to add incompatible objects.

<code php>
interface Addable
{
    operator +(mixed $other, bool $left): mixed
}

class Money implements Addable {}
class Vector2d implements Addable {}

function processValues(Addable $left, Addable $right)
{
    return $left + $right;
}

processValues(
    new Money(5, 'USD'),
    new Vector2d(5, 10)
);
</code>

Despite both of the parameters to ''processValues'' implementing the ''Addable'' interface, it's not trivial to check if it's possible to actually add the two types together.

Instead users are recommended to use specific types:

<code php>
function processMoneyValues(Money $left, Money $right)
{
    return $left + $right;
}

processMoneyValues(
    new Money(5, 'USD'),
    new Vector2d(5, 10)
);

// Type error, Vector2d can't be used as Money
</code>

This can also be caught by typing the arguments to the operator implementations themselves.

<code php>
class Money {
    operator +(Money $other, bool $left): Money {}
}

$result = new Money(5, 'USD') + new Vextor2d(5, 10);

// Type error, Vector2d can't be used as Money
</code>

==== Why can't the identity operator be overloaded? ====

The identity operator === is used to check whether two variables contain the same object, or whether two non-objects have the same type and value.

The position of this RFC is that allowing the identity operator to be overloaded isn't a useful thing to do, as it wouldn't enable any new functionality but could introduce potentially terrible bugs in PHP programs where it is used.

==== Why can't the logical operators be overloaded? ====

The logical operators &&, ||, and, or, and xor refer to a specific kind of math operation, boolean algebra, and their usage should reserved for that purpose only.

Most behavior that PHP developers would want to control with overloads to these operators can in fact be accomplished by allowing an object to control its casting to a boolean value. That is not part of this RFC, but the RFC author views that as a better way to address these operators than allowing arbitrary overloads.

==== What are some use cases? ====

  * **Arbitrary precision numbers**: operator overloads help prevent accidental casting to scalars which will overflow and lose precision.
  * **Complex numbers**: operator overloads help to implement the behavior that complex numbers display, which is incompatible with how operators function for ints or floats.
  * **Matrices and vectors**: operator overloads help to implement the unique behavior of linear algebra structures, particularly with multiplication.
  * **Currency values**: operator overloads help to prevent accidental naive calculation of values which are in different currencies.
  * **Unit based values/Values with dimensionality**: operator overloads help with unit conversion in situations where a value has a unit associated with it.
  * **Enums and Enum Sets**: operator overloads can help to implement non-standard interactions that may occur with some kinds of enums, such as config enums that may not support the type of full masking that EnumSets represent.
  * **Scalar replacement objects**: operator overloads allow the creation of objects which can be drop-in replacements for scalar types in many different programs.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Objects used with operators will no longer result in a thrown ''TypeError'', but instead a thrown ''InvalidOperatorError'' which extends ''TypeError''.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This change is proposed for PHP 8.2

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Tooling ====
The introduction of the new keyword ''operator'' will require updates to tooling used by PHP developers. This includes IDEs as well as static analysis tools.

==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Existing extensions can continue to define their own operator overloads by providing a ''do_operation'' call for their classes, however classes which are open to be extended may benefit from being updated so that their overloads can be extended by implementing the necessary methods. In order to accomplish this, the extension class would need to call ''zend_std_call_op_override'' at the start of its ''do_operation'' handler. The operator override handler will not throw the ''InvalidOperator'' error if the class entry has the type ''ZEND_INTERNAL_CLASS''. Instead, it will return the value ''FAILURE'' of type ''zend_result''. 

Thus, the following code at start of any extension's ''do_operation'' handler would be the minimal sufficient addition:

<code c>
if (zend_std_call_op_override(opcode, &result, &op1, &op2) == SUCCESS) {
    return SUCCESS;
}

// The rest of the extension's do_operation handler
</code>

==== To Opcache ====
The addition of the opcodes ZEND_IS_LARGER and ZEND_IS_LARGER_OR_EQUAL to the ZEND_AST_BINARY_OP requires several updates to the optimizer and to Opcache. This includes optimizations which are present in JIT for the other binary opcodes.

==== New Constants ====
None

==== php.ini Defaults ====
None

===== Future Scope =====
==== Exposing Core Overloads ====
As mentioned in this RFC, there are some objects within core that implement their own limited operator overloads. Deciding whether to update these objects and open their overloads for extension is left as future scope.

==== Arbitrary Infixes ====
This RFC does not support R-style operator overloading, which allows users to define custom operators outside the symbol set supported by core. Such a feature would be part of a separate RFC. However, the use of the ''operator'' keyword makes this something that could be done seamlessly in future. This is not something that this RFC author intends to do in the future.

==== Global Operator Overloads ====
This RFC deals with allowing each class to define its own interaction with operators. However, if overloading the operator itself were desired for the entire application, a different approach would be needed. This is also something that the ''operator'' keyword future proofs against, but is not an intended proposal of this RFC author.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Add limited user-defined operator overloads as described: yes/no. A 2/3 vote is required to pass. 

===== Patches and Tests =====
The draft PR for this RFC can be found here: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7388

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
