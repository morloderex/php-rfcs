====== PHP RFC: More Appropriate Date/Time Exceptions ======
  * Version: 0.9.1
  * Date: 2022-12-15 (First created: 2022-11-29)
  * Author: Derick Rethans <derick@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/datetime-exceptions


===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to introduce Date/Time extension specific exceptions and errors where this makes sense.

Right now, they are either warnings/errors, or plain "Exception" or "Error". This does not allow for catching Date/Time exceptions as they are not specific enough.

Out of scope of this RFC is changing and improving warning, Error, and Exception messages.

===== Proposal =====

The proposals is to reclassify warnings and errors as Exceptions, and introduce Date extension specific exceptions and errors.

The rationale behind all of these is the following:

  * Common errors (such as modifying readonly properties and invalid serialisation data) will throw an ''Error'', as that is what PHP does for user land code that makes these errors.
  * Programming errors that do not come forth from user input, or free form text, become a ''ValueError''.
  * Corrupted data (such as an invalid Timezone Database) becomes a ''DateError''.
  * Uninitialised objects (due to a child not calling ''parent::construct'') becomes a ''DateObjectError''
  * Issues that come to light due to user input, or free form text arguments that need to be parsed, become specific ''Exceptions'' under the ''DateException'' hierarchy:
    * Errors with timezone creation cause an ''DateInvalidTimeZoneException''.
    * Errors that come forth out of operations that can not be executed (such as using a non-special relative time specification with ''DateTime::sub()'') become a ''DateInvalidOperationException''
    * Errors with parsing the free-form text to create a ''DateTime'' and/or ''DateTimeImmutable'' object become a ''DateMalformedStringException''.
    * Errors with parsing the free-form text to create a ''DateInterval'' object become a ''DateMalformedIntervalStringException''.
    * Errors with parsing the free-form text to create a ''DatePeriod'' object become a ''DateMalformedPeriodStringException''.

The hierarchy will look like:

  * Error
    * ''"Cannot modify readonly property DatePeriod::$%s"''
    * ''"Invalid serialization data for DateTime object"'' (used with ''__set_state'' and ''__wakeup'')
    * ''"Invalid serialization data for DateTimeImmutable object"'' (used with ''__set_state'' and ''__wakeup'')
    * ''"Invalid serialization data for DateTimeZone object"'' (used with ''__set_state'' and ''__wakeup'')
    * ''"Invalid serialization data for DatePeriod object"'' (used with ''__set_state'' and ''__wakeup'')
    * ''"Unknown or bad format (%s) at position %d (%c) while unserializing: %s"'' (currently a warning)
    * ''"Trying to compare uninitialized DateTimeZone objects"''
    * ''"An iterator cannot be used with foreach by reference"''
    * ValueError (all, already like this)
      * ''"must be a two-letter ISO 3166-1 compatible country code when argument #1 ($timezoneGroup) is DateTimeZone::PER_COUNTRY"''
      * ''"must be one of SUNFUNCS_RET_TIMESTAMP, SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING, or SUNFUNCS_RET_DOUBLE"''
    * TypeError
      * ''"DatePeriod::construct() accepts (DateTimeInterface, DateInterval, int [, int]), or (DateTimeInterface, DateInterval, DateTime [, int]), or (string [, int]) as arguments"'' (already like this)
    * DateError
      * ''"Timezone database is corrupt. Please file a bug report as this should never happen"''
      * ''"Timezone initialization failed"''
      * DateObjectError
        * ''"The " #class_name " object has not been correctly initialized by its constructor"'' (DATE_CHECK_INITIALIZED)
        * ''"DatePeriod has not been initialized correctly"''
        * ''"Trying to compare uninitialized DateTimeZone objects"''
        * ''"The DateTime object has not been correctly initialized by its constructor"''
      * DateRangeError (is currently a ValueError)
        * ''"Epoch doesn't fit in a PHP integer"''
  * Exception
    * DateException
      * DateInvalidTimeZoneException (these are not easy to just change/add)
        * ''"Timezone must not contain null bytes"''
        * ''"Timezone offset is out of range (%s)"''
        * ''"Unknown or bad timezone (%s)"''
      * DateInvalidOperationException
        * ''"Only non-special relative time specifications are supported for subtraction"'' (currently a WARNING for both procedural and OO variants)
      * DateMalformedStringException
        * ''Failed to parse time string (%s) at position %d (%c): %s"''
      * DateMalformedIntervalStringException
        * ''"Unknown or bad format (%s)"'' (date_interval_initialize)
        * ''"Failed to parse interval (%s)"'' (date_interval_initialize)
        * ''"Unknown or bad format (%s) at position %d (%c): %s"'' (date_interval_create_from_date_string/OO variant; now: either a warning or exception)
        * ''"String '%s' contains non-relative elements"'' (date_interval_create_from_date_string/OO variant; now: either a warning or exception)
      * DateMalformedPeriodStringException (all DatePeriod's constructor)
        * ''"Unknown or bad format (%s)" (date_period_initialize)''
        * ''"%s(): ISO interval must contain a start date, \"%s\" given"''
        * ''"%s(): ISO interval must contain an interval, \"%s\" given"''
        * ''"%s(): ISO interval must contain an end date or a recurrence count, \"%s\" given"''
        * ''"%s(): Recurrence count must be greater than 0"''

Procedural style use of date/time functions are not effected, and will continue to use warnings and errors as they currently do.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

  - The ''"Epoch doesn't fit in a PHP integer"'' now returns a new ''DateRangeError'' instead of a generic ''ValueError'', which it does not subclass. This is only an issue for 32-bit platforms.
  - The ''"Only non-special relative time specifications are supported for subtraction"'' warning with ''DateTime::sub()'' and ''date_sub()'' becomes a new ''DateInvalidOperationException''. Leaving this with a warning and a NULL return is not useful behaviour.
  - The ''"Unknown or bad format (%s) at position %d (%c): %s"'' and ''"String '%s' contains non-relative elements"'' warnings that are created while parsing wrong/broken ''DateInterval'' strings will now throw a new ''DateMalformedIntervalStringException'' when used with the OO interface, instead of showing a warning and returning false. 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x.

===== RFC Impact =====

No impact to any other extensions or opcode.

===== Open Issues =====

There are currently no open issues.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Warnings and errors that are currently generated by the procedural versions of the Date/Time functionality is not impacted. Only the Object Orientated interface is.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Either for, or against.

===== Patches and Tests =====

There is no patch yet.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== Rejected Features =====

None yet.

===== ChangeLog =====

0.9.1
  * Clarified that changing/improving messages is out of scope
  * Clarified that the "Invalid serialization data for * object" are used for both PHP's unserialize, as well as ''__set_state''.
