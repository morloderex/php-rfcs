====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 8.5 ======
  * Date: 2024-09-26
  * Authors:
    * Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Pending Implementation
  * Implementation: TBD

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.5 and remove it in PHP 9 (except where otherwise noted).

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * Deprecate ''key_length'' parameter of <php>openssl_pkey_derive()</php>
  * Deprecate PDO's 'uri:' scheme
  * Deprecate Reflection*::setAccessible()
  * Deprecate FILTER_DEFAULT constant
  * Make ''$filter'' parameter mandatory for <php>filter_*()</php> functions
  * Deprecate FILTER_CALLBACK filter

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority.
All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.5 and removal in PHP 9 (except where otherwise noted).

==== Deprecate key_length parameter of openssl_pkey_derive() ====

This parameter is useless and confusing for users. It just truncates lenght for ECDH but does nothing or fail for increasing lenghts and DH truncation. This was raised during the security audit.

See: https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/3789

==== Deprecate PDO's 'uri:' scheme ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

TODO: https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/d7bdf902e5b88189037883d462e422838bd9be55/ext/pdo/pdo_dbh.c#L323-L335

==== Deprecate Reflection*::setAccessible() ====

Author: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>

TODO: Follow-up for https://wiki.php.net/rfc/make-reflection-setaccessible-no-op

==== Deprecate FILTER_DEFAULT constant ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The <php>FILTER_DEFAULT</php> constant is an alias for the <php>FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW</php> constant.
This has been the case since at least PHP 5.3.
This is confusing and seems to indicate that it corresponds to the filter set by the ''filter.default'' INI setting.
Moreover, this INI setting was deprecated in [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_1#filterdefault_ini_setting|PHP 8.1]].

As this constant is confusing and misleading, we propose to deprecate it.

==== Make $filter parameter mandatory for filter_*() functions ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The <php>filter_*()</php> functions do not require passing the <php>$filter</php> parameter, the default value of it is <php>FILTER_DEFAULT</php> which is an alias for the <php>FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW</php> filter.
This filter does **nothing** if no flags are provided.
This behaviour is indicative of a bug, therefore, we propose to make the <php>$filter</php> argument mandatory and emit a deprecation notice if the default value is used.

==== Deprecate FILTER_CALLBACK filter ====

Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>

The <php>FILTER_CALLBACK</php> filter allows providing a function to call on the value to filter.
This makes little sense as one can pass the value to filter directly to the function instead of passing by the filter extension.

Similarly, to filter an array of values, it is easier and more intuitive to use the <php>array_map()</php> function rather than the filter extension.

As such, we propose to deprecate this filter.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.5 additional deprecation notices will be emitted.
The actual removal of the affected functionality will happen no earlier than PHP 9.

===== Removed from this proposal =====

The following entries were originally added to this proposal and then dropped.
