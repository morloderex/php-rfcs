===== Introduction =====

Recently, during a Coding Standards discussion, someone came up with the idea of forbidden the //compact()// function. One of the arguments was that this function does not report undefined variables passed to it. After checking its implementation and documentation, nothing was founded justifying the reason of why this has been this way since ever. 

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes the addition of a notice in the //compact()// function when a not defined variable had been passed to it.

<code php>
$foo = 'bar';

$baz = compact('foz'); // Notice: compact(): Undefined variable: foz
</code>
  
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Undefined variables passed to //compact()// will now be reported as a notice.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====

The next PHP 7.x, current version 7.3.

===== RFC Impact =====

This RFC has only impact in the //compact()// function.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Since this RFC contains a Backward Incompatible Change, 2/3 majority is required.
