====== PHP RFC: Add RFC 3986 and WHATWG compliant URI parsing support ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2024-06-11
  * Author: Máté Kocsis, kocsismate@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14461

===== Introduction =====

URIs and URLs are one of the most fundamental concepts of the web because they make it possible to reference specific resources on a network. URLs were originally defined by Tim Berners-Lee in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738|RFC 1738]], but since then other specifications have also emerged, out of which [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986|RFC 3986]] and [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#title|WHATWG URL]] are the most notable ones. The former one updates the original RFC 1738 and defines URIs, while the latter one specifies how browsers should treat URLs.

Despite the ubiquitous nature of URLs and URIs, they are not so unequivocal as people may think, because different clients treat and parse them differently by either following one of the standards, or even worse, not following any at all. Unfortunately, PHP falls into the latter category: the ''parse_url()'' function is offered for parsing URLs, however, it isn't compliant with any standards. Even the PHP manual contains the following warning:

<blockquote>This function may not give correct results for relative or invalid URLs, and the results may not even match common behavior of HTTP clients. ...</blockquote>

Incompatibility with current standards is a serious issue, as it hinders interoperability with different tools (i.e. HTTP clients), or it can result in bugs which are difficult to notice. For example, cURL's URL parsing implementation is based on RFC 3986, that's why URLs validated by [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.constants.php#constant.filter-validate-url|FILTER_VALIDATE_URL]] may not necessarily be accepted when passed to cURL.

===== Proposal =====

In order to address the above mentioned problems, a new, always available ''URI'' extension is to be added to the standard library. The extension would support parsing, validating, modifying, and recomposing (converting the parsed structures back to strings) URIs based on both RFC 3986 and the WHATWG URL specifications, as well as resolving references (turning a (relative) URI to an absolute one by applying a base URI to it). For this purpose, the following internal classes and methods are added:

<code php>
namespace Uri {
    class UriException extends \Exception
    {
    }

    class UninitializedUriException extends \Uri\UriException
    {
    }

    class UriOperationException extends \Uri\UriException
    {
    }

    class InvalidUriException extends \Uri\UriException
    {
        public readonly array $errors;
    }
}
</code>

===== API Design =====

First and foremost, the new URI parsing API contains two URI implementations, ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri'' and ''Uri\WhatWg\Url'', representing RFC 3986 and WHATWG URIs, respectively. Having separate classes for the two specifications makes it possible to properly model URIs with all their details and nuances. Actually, it could cause a security vulnerability to have wrong assumptions about the origin of a URI, as Daniel Stenberg (author of cURL) writes [[https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/|in one of his blog posts]], that's why at least in security-sensitive applications, it's important to explicitly express which specification is used.

==== Instantiation ====

Both built-in URI implementations are ''readonly'' classes, and support instantiation via two methods:

  * the constructor: It expects a required URI and an optional base URI parameter in order to support [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5|reference resolution]]. In case of an invalid URI, a ''Uri\InvalidUriException'' is thrown.
  * a ''parse()'' factory method: It expects the same parameters as the constructor does, but in case of an invalid URI, ''null'' is returned instead of throwing an exception. Using this method is recommended for validating URIs and/or parsing URIs from untrusted input.

<code php>
$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://example.com"); // An RFC 3986 URI instance is created
$uri = Uri\Rfc3986\Uri::parse("https://example.com"); // An RFC 3986 URI instance is created

$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("invalid uri"); // A Uri/InvalidUriException is thrown
$uri = Uri\Rfc3986\Uri::parse("invalid uri"); // null is returned in case of an invalid URI

$url = new Uri\WhatWg\Url("https://example.com"); // A WHATWG URL instance is created
$url = Uri\WhatWg\Url::parse("https://example.com"); // A WHATWG URL instance is created

$url = new Uri\WhatWg\Url("invalid uri"); // A Uri/InvalidUriException is thrown
$url = Uri\WhatWg\Url::parse("invalid uri", null, $errors); // null is returned, and an array of WhatWgError objects are passed by reference to $errors
</code>

As it can be seen, ''Uri\WhatWg\Url::parse()'' can pass additional information about the triggered validation errors by reference, [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error|as specified by WHATWG]]. In the example above, ''$errors'' will contain the following value:

<code PHP>
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  object(Uri\WhatWg\WhatWgError)#1 (2) {
    ["context"]=>
    string(11) "invalid uri"
    ["type"]=>
    enum(Uri\WhatWg\WhatWgErrorType::MissingSchemeNonRelativeUrl)
  }
}
</code>

However, it is also possible that a WHATWG URL can be parsed successfully with some (soft) validation errors. When instantiating a WHATWG URI via its constructor, only soft errors are passed by reference, while hard errors are thrown. The following example demonstrates the former case:

<code PHP>
$softErrors = [];
$url = new Uri\WhatWg\Url(" https://example.org", null, $softErrors);
var_dump($url->toMachineFriendlyString());        // https://example.org
var_dump($softErrors[0]->type);                   // enum(Uri\WhatWg\WhatWgErrorType::InvalidUrlUnit)
</code>

==== Accessing URI components ====

The individual URI components can be retrieved via getters, and immutable modification is possible via "wither" methods. While [[rfc:property-hooks|property hooks]] and/or [[rfc:asymmetric-visibility-v2|asymmetric visibility]] could be a modern replacement for getters, the RFC still chooses the more conservative getter-based approach because each URI component actually needs multiple getters in order to best serve the vastly different needs users may have. This topic is discussed in details [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api#how_special_characters_are_handled|below]]. For now, let's see a very basic example for accessing URI components:

<code php>
$uri1 = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://example.com");
$uri2 = $uri->withHost("test.com");

echo $uri1->getHost();                            // example.com
echo $uri2->getHost();                            // test.com
</code>

The above example demonstrates that withers create a new instance for each modification, leaving the original object intact. However, an exception is thrown if a modification resulted in an invalid URI. This way, URIs always stay valid:

<code php>
$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://example.com");
$uri->withHost("/");                              // A Uri/InvalidUriException is thrown
</code>

==== Recomposition ====

Besides accessors, URI implementations contain various "''toString''" methods as well. They can be used for recomposing the URI components back to a string. Why such methods are necessary at all instead of simply returning the input URI string? It's because URI parsers may have applied some modifications to the input during parsing. This is specifically the case for the WHATWG specification, since it mandates the usage of quite some transformations (i.e. removal of extraneous ''/'' characters in the scheme, lowercasing some URI components, application of IDNA encoding). On the other hand, RFC 3986 leaves the originally supplied URI intact by default. For reference, the following algorithms are implemented:
  * RFC 3986: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.3
  * WHATWG: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-serializing

Peculiarly, ''Uri\WhatWg\Url'' has two "toString" methods in order to properly and safely support IDNA (internationalized domain names):

<code php>
$url = new Uri\WhatWg\Url("HTTPS://////EXAMPLE.com");
echo $url->toMachineFriendlyString();             // https://example.com/

$url = new Uri\WhatWg\Url("HTTPS://////你好你好.com");
echo $url->toMachineFriendlyString();             // https://xn--6qqa088eba/
echo $url->toHumanFriendlyString();               // https://你好你好/
</code>

The ''toMachineFriendlyString()'' method recomposes the URI in a format which is most suitable for machine processing (domains using IDNA characters are translated to ASCII characters), while the ''toHumanFriendlyString()'' method is a much more user-friendly representation that displays the host as a Unicode string. Besides just user-friendliness, this is important for security reasons, alleviating the human risk factor in exploits. E.g. "xn--google.com" could deceive the uninitiated reader that it is a Google domain, however the IDNA domain decodes to "䕮䕵䕶䕱.com” in fact.

As RFC 3986 doesn't support IDNA (only [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987|RFC 3987 does]]), it's not a concern for ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri''. Therefore, it misses the above methods, but it has a regular "toString" method:

<code php>
$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("HTTPS://EXAMPLE.com");
echo $uri->toString();                             // https://EXAMPLE.com/

$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("HTTPS://你好你好.com");
var_dump($uri);                                    // NULL
</code>

The attentive reader may have noticed that neither URI implementations contain a ''%%__toString()%%'' magic method. This is a deliberate design decision not to add this method to the built-in URI classes, as doing so could cause incorrect results when using equality comparison (''==''). Given the following example:

<code php>
$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://EXAMPLE.com");

var_dump($uri == 'HTTPS://example.com/');
</code>

The output would be ''bool(false)'' if ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri'' contained a ''%%__toString()%%'' method, because of the ''$uri'' object being automatically converted to its string representation (''https://example.com/'') which is then compared against ''HTTPS://example.com''. However, as we will see in the following section, the two URIs should be indeed equal, as a result of normalization. Furthermore, equality of URIs usually disregards the fragment component, thus a ''https://example.com#foo'' URI would also yield a false positive result in the example.

==== Normalization ====

As mentioned above, RFC 3986 has the notion of [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2|normalization]], which is an optional process for canonizing different URI identifying the same resource to the same URI. E.g. the ''https://EXAMPLE.com'' and the ''HTTPS://example.com/'' URIs both refer to the same resource, so they can be normalized to ''https://example.com''. WHATWG doesn't have this concept (all transformations are applied during parsing), therefore neither ''Uri\WhatWg\Url'' supports any such capabilities. However, ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri'' supports normalization the following way:

  * Recomposition:
  * Accessing URI components

Let's see an example for retrieving the normalized path component (''foo/../bar'' becomes ''bar''):

<code php>
$uri1 = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://EXAMPLE.COM/foo/../bar");
$uri2 = $uri1->normalize();

echo $uri1->getPath();                           // foo/../bar
echo $uri2->getPath();                           // bar
</code>

Another example for the two ways to return the normalized string representation of an URI:

<code php>
$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://EXAMPLE.COM/foo/../bar");

echo $uri->toString();                          // https://EXAMPLE.COM/foo/../bar"
echo $uri->normalize()->toString();             // https://example.com/bar
echo $uri->toNormalizedString();                // https://example.com/bar
</code>

==== Comparison ====

Normalization is especially important when it comes to comparing URIs because it reduces the likelihood of false positive results, since URI comparison is based on checking whether the URIs represent the same resources. Therefore, the ''equals()'' method can be used for comparing URIs. First, the method only accepts URI objects of the same specification, since it doesn't make sense to compare URIs of different standards. Then they normalize (if applicable) and recompose the URI represented by the object as well as the URI received in the argument list to a string, and checks whether the two strings match. By default, the fragment component is disregarded.

<code php>
// An RFC 3986 URI equals another RFC 3986 URI that has the same string representation after normalization
new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://example.COM")->equals(new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://EXAMPLE.COM")));  // true

// A WHATWG URL equals another WHATWG URL that has the same string representation
new Uri\WhatWg\Url("https:////example.COM/")->equals(new Uri\WhatWg\Url("https://EXAMPLE.COM")));  // true

// A URI cannot be compared against another URI of a different specification
new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://example.com/")->equals(new Uri\WhatWg\Url("https://example.com/"));  // throws TypeError
</code>

It should be noted that the ''equals()'' method could also accept URI strings. It was a deliberate decision not to allow such arguments, because it would be unclear how the comparison works in this case: Should the passed in string be also normalized, or exact string match should be performed? This is a question that don't have to be answered when only a URI object parameter type is supported.

The same question - combined with the fact that the construct is not supported in userland - led us not to overload the equality operator.

==== Resolution ====

Last but not least, URIs support a ''resolve()'' method that is able to resolve potentially relative URIs with the current object as the base URI:

<code php>
$uri = new Uri\Rfc3986\Uri("https://example.com");

echo $uri->resolve("/foo")->toString();                 //  https://example.com/foo

$url = new Uri\WhatWg\Url("https://example.com");

echo $url->resolve("/foo")->toMachineFriendlyString();  //  https://example.com/foo
</code>

This method is a shorthand for ''new get_class($uri)("/foo", $base->toString())''.

===== Naming considerations =====

After multiple iterations, the RFC settled on using the ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri'' and the ''Uri\WhatWg\Url'' class names at last. By having different subnamespaces for the two specifications, it became possible to group together all the WHATWG related classes (''Uri\WhatWg\WhatWgErrorType'', ''Uri\WhatWg\WhatWgError''). Additionally, the chosen class names (''Uri'' and ''Url'') try to disambiguate how the two specifications actually work:

  * RFC 3986 works with actual relative URIs which don't have a scheme
  * WHATWG can only work with URLs (absolute URIs having a scheme)

The additional benefit of using different class names is that there is no clash when both classes are imported in the same PHP file.

===== How special characters are handled? =====

Encoding and decoding special characters is a crucial aspect of URI parsing. For this purpose, both RFC 3986 and WHATWG use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding|percent-encoding]] (i.e. the ''%'' character is encoded as ''%25''). However, the two standards differ significantly in this regard:

RFC 3986 defines that "URIs that differ in the replacement of an unreserved character with its corresponding percent-encoded US-ASCII octet are equivalent", which means that percent-encoded characters and their decoded form are equivalent. On the contrary, WHATWG defines URL equivalence by the equality of the serialized URLs, and never decodes percent-encoded characters, except in the host. This implies that percent-encoded characters are not equivalent to their decoded form (except in the host).

The difference between RFC 3986 and WHATWG comes from the fact that the point of view of a maintainer of the WHATWG specification is that [[https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/606#issuecomment-926395864|webservers may legitimately choose to consider encoded and decoded paths distinct, and a standard cannot force them not to do so]]. This is a substantial BC break compared to RFC 3986, and it is actually a source of confusion among users of the WHATWG specification based on the large number of tickets related to this question.

===== Why a common URI interface is not supported? =====

[[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#35-psrhttpmessageuriinterface|PSR-7 UriInterface]] is currently the de-facto interface for representing URIs in userland. That's why it seemed a good candidate for adoption at the first glance. However, the current RFC didn't pursue to reuse it for the following reasons:

  * PSR-7 strictly follows the RFC 3986 standard, and therefore only has a notion of [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.1|"userinfo"]], rather than [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-representation|"user" and "password"]] which is used by the WHATWG specification.
  * PSR-7's ''UriInterface'' have non-nullable method return types except for ''UriInterface::getPort()'' whereas WHATWG specifically allows ''null'' values.

As an alternative, the RFC attempted to define a new URI interface (called ''Uri\Uri''), but it turned out late in the RFC process that the RFC 3986 and WHATWG specifications have so many smaller or bigger differences between them that a common URI interface is not really feasible to define.

===== Why query parameter manipulation is not supported? =====

It would be very useful for a URI implementation to support direct query parameter manipulation. Actually, the WHATWG URL specification contains a [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlsearchparams|URLSearchParams]] interface that could be used for the purpose. However, the position of this RFC is not to include this interface **yet** [[https://externals.io/message/123997#124077|for the following reasons]]:

  * Query string parsing is a fuzzy area, since there is no established rules how to parse query strings
  * The ''URLSearchParams'' interface doesn't follow either RFC 1738, or RFC 3986
  * The already large scope of the RFC would increase even more

For all these reasons, the topic of query parameter manipulation should be discussed as a followup to the current RFC.

===== Parser Library Choice =====

Adding a WHATWG compliant URL parser to the standard library [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11315|was originally attempted in 2023]]. The implementation used [[https://www.ada-url.com|ADA URL parser]] as its parser backend which is known for its ultimate performance. At last, the proof of concept was abandoned due to some technical limitations that weren't possible to resolve.

Specifically, ADA is written in C++, and requires a compiler supporting C++17 at least. Despite the fact that it has a C wrapper,   its tight compiler requirements would make it unprecedented, and practically impossible to add the ''URI'' extension to PHP as a required extension, because PHP has never had a C++ compiler dependency for the always enabled extensions, only optional extensions (like ''Intl'') can be written in C++.

The firm position of this RFC is that an URL parser extension should always be available, therefore a different parser backend written in pure C should be found. Fortunately, Niels Dossche proposed [[rfc:domdocument_html5_parser|PHP RFC: DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization]] not long after the experiment with ADA, and his work required bundling parts of the [[https://lexbor.com/|Lexbor]] browser engine. This library is written in C, and coincidentally contains a WHATWG compliant URL parsing submodule, therefore it makes it suitable to be used as the library of choice.

For parsing URIs according to RFC 3986, the [[https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/|URIParser]] library was chosen. It is a lightweight and fast C library with no dependencies. It uses the "new BSD license" which is compatible with the current PHP license as well as the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php_license_update|PHP License Update RFC]].

===== Plugability =====

The capability provided by ''parse_url()'' is used for multiple purposes in the internal PHP source:

  * ''SoapClient::_doRequest()'': parsing the ''$location'' parameter as well as the value of the ''Location'' header
  * FTP/FTPS stream wrapper: ''parse_url()'' is used for connecting to an URL, renaming a file, following the ''Location'' header
  * ''FILTER_VALIDATE_URL'': validating URLs
  * SSL/TLS socket communication: parsing the target URL
  * GET/POST session: accepting the session ID from the query string, manipulating the output URL to automatically include the session ID ([[rfc:deprecate-get-post-sessions|Deprecate GET/POST sessions RFC]]

It would cause inconsistency and a security vulnerability if parsing of URIs based on the two specifications referred above were supported in userland, but the legacy ''parse_url()'' based behavior was kept internally without the possibility to use the new API. That's why the current RFC was designed with plugability in mind.

Specifically, supported parser backends would have to be registered by using a similar method how [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/password_registry|password hashing algorithms are registered]]. On one hand, this approach makes it possible for 3rd party extensions to leverage URI parser backends other than the built-in ones (i.e. support for ADA URL could also be added). But more importantly, an internal "interface" for parsing and handling URIs is defined this way so that it now becomes possible to configure the used backend for each use-case. Please note that URI parser backend registration is only supported for internal code: registering custom user-land implementations is not possible for now, mainly in order to prevent a possible new attack surface.

While it would sound natural to add a php.ini configuration option to configure the used parser backend globally, this option was rejected during the discussion period of the RFC because it would result in unsafe code that is controlled by global state: since any invoked piece of code can change the used parser backend, one should always check the current value of the config option before parsing URIs (and in case of libraries, the original option should also be reset after usage). Instead, the RFC proposes to add the following configuration options that only affect a single use-case:

  * ''SoapClient::_doRequest()'': a new optional ''$uriParserClass'' parameter is added accepting ''string'' or ''null'' arguments. ''Null'' represents the original (''parse_url()'') based method, while the new backends will be used when passing either ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri::class'' or ''Uri\WhatWg\Url::class''.
  * FTP/FTPS stream wrapper: a new ''uri_parser_class'' stream context option is added
  * ''FILTER_VALIDATE_URL'': ''filter_*'' functions can be configured by passing a ''uri_parser_class'' key to the ''$options'' array
  * SSL/TLS socket communication: a new ''uri_parser_class'' stream context option is added
  * GET/POST session: since this feature is deprecated by ([[rfc:deprecate-get-post-sessions|Deprecate GET/POST sessions RFC]], no configuration is added.

There are certain file-handling functions that can already accept URIs as strings: these include ''file_get_contents()'', ''file()'', ''fopen()''. As per the current proposal, the URI parser can be supplied in the ''$context'' parameter to these functions, but this approach is somewhat tedious, especially if the URI already had to be parsed previously (i.e. for validation purposes). Let's consider the following example:

<code php>
$url = $_GET['url'];
validate_url($url);

$context = stream_context_create([
    "uri_parser_class" => \Uri\Rfc3986\Uri::class,
]);
$contents = file_get_contents($url, context: $context);
</code>

However, there are other much more convenient approaches, but the current RFC still goes with the current, less ergonomic one, as going either way would need more discussion, and a scope creep. The improvement possibilities include passing URI instances to the functions in question, or converting URIs to streams based on [[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URL.html#openStream()|Java's example]].

===== Performance Considerations =====

The implementation of ''parse_url()'' is optimized for performance. This also means that it doesn't deal with validation properly and disregards some edge cases. A fully standard compliant parser will generally be slower than ''parse_url()'', because it has to execute more code. Fortunately, this overhead is usually minimal thanks to the huge efforts of the maintainers of the Lexbor and the uriparser libraries.

According to the rough benchmarks, the following results were measured:

==== Time of parsing of a basic URL (1000 times) ====

  * ''parse_url()'': ''0.000208 sec''
  * ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri'': ''0.000311 sec''
  * ''Uri\WhatWg\Url'': ''0.000387 sec''

==== Time of parsing of a complex URL (1000 times) ====

  * ''parse_url()'': ''0.000962''
  * ''Uri\Rfc3986\Uri'': ''0.000911 sec''
  * ''Uri\WhatWg\Url'': ''0.000962 sec''

===== Examples in Other Languages =====

==== Go ====

Even though Go's standard library ships with a ''net/url'' package containing a ''url.Parse()'' function along with some utility functions, unfortunately it's not highlighted in the documentation which specification it conforms to. However, it's not very promising that the manual mentions the following sentence:

<blockquote>Trying to parse a hostname and path without a scheme is invalid but may not necessarily return an error, due to parsing ambiguities.</blockquote>

==== Java ====

In Java, a [[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URL.html|URL]] class has been available from the beginning. Unfortunately, it's unclear whether it adheres to any URI specification. Speaking about its design, ''URL'' itself is immutable, and somewhat peculiarly, it contains some methods which can open a connection to the URL, or get its content.

Since Java 20, all of the ''URL'' constructors are deprecated in favor of using ''URI.toURL()''. The [[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html|URI]] class conforms to [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2396|RFC 2396]] standard.

==== C# ====

C# has an extensive support for URIs, although the [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-uri|documentation]] doesn't mention which the specification is uses. Uniquely, the standard library offers advanced features such as a [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uribuilder?view=net-9.0|UriBuilder]], and [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uriparser?view=net-9.0|customizable URI Parsers]].

==== NodeJS ====

NodeJS recently added support for a decent WHATWG URL compliant [[https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#the-whatwg-url-api|URL parser]], built on top of the ADA URL parser project.

==== Python ====

Python also comes with built-in support for parsing URLs, made available by the [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse|urllib.parse.urlparse]] and [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit|urllib.parse.urlsplit]] functions. According to the documentation, "these functions incorporate some aspects of both [the WHATWG URL and the RFC 3986 specifications], but cannot be claimed compliant with either".

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

The next minor PHP version (either PHP 8.5 or 9.0, whichever comes first).

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

SAPIs should adopt the new internal API for parsing URIs instead of using the existing ''php_url_parse*()'' API. Additionally, they should add support for configuring the URI parsing backend.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Extensions should adopt the new internal API for parsing URIs instead of using the existing ''php_url_parse*()'' API. Additionally, they should add support for configuring the URI parsing backend.

==== To Opcache ====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

  * Support for [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987|RFC 3987 (Internationalized Resource Identifiers)]]
  * Support for new parser backends so that other libraries (like [[https://www.ada-url.com/|Ada URL]], or [[https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-url.html|cURL]]) could also be used in addition to uriparser and Lexbor.
  * Support for an abstraction for manipulating query parameters, like [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlsearchparams|URLSearchParams]] defined by WHATWG
  * The ''parse_url()'' function can be deprecated at some distant point of time
