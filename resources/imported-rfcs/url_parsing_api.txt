====== PHP RFC: Add RFC3986 and WHATWG compliant URI parsing support ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2024-06-11
  * Author: Máté Kocsis, kocsismate@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14461

===== Introduction =====

URIs and URLs are one of the most fundamental concepts of the web because they make it possible to reference specific resources on a network. URLs were originally defined by Tim Berners-Lee in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738|RFC 1738]], but since then other specifications have also emerged, out of which [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986|RFC 3986]] and [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#title|WHATWG URL]] are the most notable ones. The former one updates the original RFC 1738 and defines URIs, while the latter one specifies how browsers should treat URLs.

Despite the ubiquitous nature of URLs and URIs, they are not so unequivocal as people may think, because different clients treat and parse them differently by either following one of the standards, or even worse, not following any at all. Unfortunately, PHP falls into the latter category: the ''parse_url()'' function is offered for parsing URLs, however, it isn't compliant with any standards. Even the PHP manual contains the following warning:

<blockquote>This function may not give correct results for relative or invalid URLs, and the results may not even match common behavior of HTTP clients. ...</blockquote>

Incompatibility with current standards is a serious issue, as it hinders interoperability with different tools (i.e. HTTP clients), or it can result in bugs which are difficult to notice. For example, cURL's URL parsing implementation is based on RFC 3986, that's why URLs validated by [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.constants.php#constant.filter-validate-url|FILTER_VALIDATE_URL]] may not necessarily be accepted when passed to cURL.

===== Proposal =====

In order to address the above mentioned problems, a new, always available ''URI'' extension is to be added to the standard library. The extension would support parsing, validating, as well as recomposing (converting the parsed structures back to strings) URIs based on both RFC 3986 and the WHATWG URL specifications. For this purpose, the following internal classes and methods are added:

<code php>
namespace Uri;

{
}

{
    public readonly array $errors;

===== Parser Library Choice =====

Adding a WHATWG compliant URL parser to the standard library [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11315|was originally attempted in 2023]]. The implementation used [[https://www.ada-url.com|ADA URL parser]] as its parser backend which is known for its ultimate performance. At last, the proof of concept was abandoned due to some technical limitations that weren't possible to resolve.

Specifically, ADA is written in C++, and requires a compiler supporting C++17 at least. Despite the fact that it has a C wrapper,   its tight compiler requirements would make it unprecedented, and practically impossible to add the ''URI'' extension to PHP as a required extension, because PHP has never had a C++ compiler dependency for the always enabled extensions, only optional extensions (like ''Intl'') can be written in C++.

The firm position of this RFC is that an URL parser extension should always be available, therefore a different parser backend written in pure C should be found. Fortunately, Niels Dossche proposed [[rfc:domdocument_html5_parser|PHP RFC: DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization]] not long after the experiment with ADA, and his work required bundling parts of the [[https://lexbor.com/|Lexbor]] browser engine. This library is written in C, and coincidentally contains a WHATWG compliant URL parsing submodule, therefore it makes it suitable to be used as the library of choice.

For parsing URIs according to RFC 3986, the [[https://github.com/uriparser/uriparser/|URIParser]] library was chosen. It is a lightweight and relatively fast library with no dependencies. It uses the "new BSD license" which is compatible with the current PHP license as well as the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php_license_update|PHP License Update RFC]].

===== Plugability =====

The capability provided by ''parse_url()'' is used for multiple purposes in the internal PHP source:

  * ''SoapClient::_doRequest()'': parsing the ''$location'' parameter as well as the value of the ''Location'' header
  * FTP/FTPS stream wrapper: ''parse_url()'' is used for connecting to an URL, renaming a file, following the ''Location'' header
  * ''FILTER_VALIDATE_URL'': validating URLs
  * SSL/TLS socket communication: parsing the target URL
  * GET/POST session: accepting the session ID from the query string, manipulating the output URL to automatically include the session ID ([[rfc:deprecate-get-post-sessions|Deprecate GET/POST sessions RFC]]

It would cause an inconsistency if parsing of URIs based on the two specifications referred above was supported in userland, but the legacy ''parse_url()'' based behavior was kept internally without the possibility to use the new API. That's why the current RFC was designed with plugability in mind.

Specifically, supported parser backends would have to be registered by using a similar method how [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/password_registry|password hashing algorithms are registered]]. On one hand, this approach would make it possible for 3rd party extensions to leverage URI parser backends other than the built-in ones (i.e. support for ADA URL could also be added). But more importantly, an internal "interface" for parsing and handling URIs is defined this way so that it now becomes possible to configure how URIs should be parsed throughout PHP's codebase.

For this purpose, a ''uri.default_handler'' PHP INI option is added with the following possible values:

  * **''rfc3986'':** parsing based on the RFC 3986 standard via the uriparser library
  * **''whatwg'':** parsing based on the WHATWG specification via the Lexbor library
  * **''parse_url'':** parsing based on the behavior of the legacy ''parse_url()'' function (default value)

Please note that setting the ''uri.default_handler'' PHP INI option does not affect the behavior of the ''parse_url()'' internal function itself, since the new URI parsing API is expected to be used from now on instead of this function.

<code php>
ini_set("uri.default_handler", "rfc3986");

filter_var("https://example.com", FILTER_VALIDATE_URL);
</code>

The above piece of code validates ''https://example.com'' based on the RFC 3986 standard, while the below piece of code validates it based on the WHATWG specification:

<code php>
ini_set("uri.default_handler", "whatwg");

filter_var("https://example.com", FILTER_VALIDATE_URL);
</code>

===== Performance Considerations =====

The implementation of ''parse_url()'' is optimized for performance. This also means that it doesn't deal with validation properly and disregards some edge cases. A fully standard compliant parser will generally be slower than ''parse_url()'', because it has to execute more code.

According to the rough initial benchmarks, the following relative results were measured:

==== Time of parsing of a basic URL (smaller % is faster) ====

  * ''parse_url()'': 100%
  * ''Uri\Uri::fromRfc3986()'': 150%
  * ''Uri\Uri::fromWhatwg()'': 300%

==== Time of parsing of a complex URL (smaller % is faster) ====

  * ''parse_url()'': 100%
  * ''Uri\Uri::fromRfc3986()'': 50%
  * ''Uri\Uri::fromWhatwg()'': 100%

More accurate benchmarks are to be performed later.

===== API Design =====

The new URI parsing API consists of multiple classes ''Uri\Uri'' being the (abstract) base class. Besides getters for accessing the individual URI components and a ''__toString()'' method, it contains two factory methods: ''Uri\Uri::fromRfc3986()'' and ''Uri\Uri::fromWhatwg()''. These methods are generally expected to be used for instantiating the two concrete implementations: ''Uri\Rfc3986Uri'' and ''Uri\WhatwgUri''.

Having separate classes for the separate URI implementations makes it possible to refer to a specific implementation, or require one at the type level via type declarations. Doing so is important when one needs to work with only one of the URI implementations. However, for use-cases where it is not important which implementation is passed, the non-instantiable ''Uri\Uri'' base class is at hand.

Currently, the ''Uri\Uri'' class does not support mutation. It is because the underlying libraries do not support changing the individual URI components once the input URI is parsed. Support for the missing features may be added to uriparser and lexbor in the future though.

===== Relation to PSR-7 =====

[[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#35-psrhttpmessageuriinterface|PSR-7 UriInterface]] is currently the de-facto interface in userland for representing URIs. That's why it seems a good candidate for adoption. However, the current RFC does not purse this for the following reasons:

  * PSR-7's ''UriInterface'' supports mutation of the URI objects via "wither" methods (i.e. ''UriInterface::withScheme()''). This is not currently possible to achieve for the ''URI'' extension due to technical limitations mentioned above.
  * PSR-7 strictly follows the RFC 3986 standard, and therefore only has a notion of [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.1|"userinfo"]], rather than [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-representation|"user" and "password"]] which is used by the WhatWG specification.
  * PSR-7's ''UriInterface'' have non-nullable method return types expect for ''UriInterface::getPort()'' whereas WhatWG specifically allows ''null'' values.

Due to its immutability, The ''Uri\Uri'' class is not compatible with the [[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#35-psrhttpmessageuriinterface|PSR-7 UriInterface]].

The ''Uri\Uri'' class is purposefully extendible in userland code as well.

===== Examples in Other Languages =====

==== Go ====

Even though Go's standard library ships with a ''net/url'' package containing a ''url.Parse()'' function along with some utility functions, unfortunately it's not highlighted in the documentation which standard it conforms to. However, it's not very promising that the manual mentions the following sentence:

<blockquote>Trying to parse a hostname and path without a scheme is invalid but may not necessarily return an error, due to parsing ambiguities.</blockquote>

==== Java ====

In Java, a [[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URL.html|URL]] class has been available from the beginning. Unfortunately, it's unclear whether it adheres to any URL standards. Speaking about its design, ''URL'' itself is immutable, and somewhat peculiarly, it contains some methods which can open a connection to the URL, or get its content.

Since Java 20, all of the ''URL'' constructors are deprecated in favor of using ''URI.toURL()''. The [[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html|URI]] class conforms to [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2396|RFC 2396]] standard.

==== NodeJS ====

NodeJS recently added support for a decent WHATWG URL compliant [[https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#the-whatwg-url-api|URL parser]], built on top of the ADA URL parser project.

==== Python ====

Python also comes with built-in support for parsing URLs, made available by the [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse|urllib.parse.urlparse]] and [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit|urllib.parse.urlsplit]] functions. According to the documentation, "these functions incorporate some aspects of both [the WHATWG URL and the RFC 3986 specifications], but cannot be claimed compliant with either".

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

The next minor PHP version (either PHP 8.5 or 9.0, whichever comes first).

===== Future Scope =====

  * Support for new parser backends so that other libraries (like [[https://www.ada-url.com/|Ada URL]], or [[https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-url.html|cURL]]) could also be used in addition to uriparser and Lexbor.
  * In addition to the configuration of the globally used URI parser via the ''uri.default_handler'' INI option, the URI parser could also be set at the individual feature level
  * Support for mutation of the URI components could be added, similarly to the PSR-7 ''UriInterface'' (i.e. ''UriInterface::withScheme()''.
  * Support for an abstraction for manipulating query parameters, like [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlsearchparams|URLSearchParams]] defined by WhatWg
  * The ''parse_url()'' function can be deprecated at some distant point of time
