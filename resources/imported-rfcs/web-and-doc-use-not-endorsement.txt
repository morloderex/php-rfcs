  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2024-08-24
  * Author: Jim Winstead, jimw@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/web-and-doc-use-not-endorsement

===== Introduction =====

The PHP project has had a long-standing but unwritten, vague, and inconsistently applied proscription against mentioning or using third-party PHP projects on the grounds that it implies some sort of endorsement over other third-party projects. This has impacted the web projects (bugs.php.net, etc) and documentation in ways that seem harmful to the overall PHP community.

===== Proposal =====

Adopt this statement of principle:

> The web and documentation projects within the PHP Project can use or document the existence of third-party PHP projects as part of their roles in supporting the overall PHP community. Such use does not represent endorsement of those third-party projects by the PHP Project.

===== Open Issues =====
  * None yet.

===== Future Scope =====
  * None, except this guidance could be changed in the future by another RFC or subsequent governance mechanism.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * Adopt the statement of principle in this proposal? Yes/No

===== References =====
  * Drama that ensued when a third-party development dependency was pushed into web-bugs: https://github.com/php/web-bugs/pull/77
  * PR to add references to Composer and Packagist to the documentation: https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/3677
