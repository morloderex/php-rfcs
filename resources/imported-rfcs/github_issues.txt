====== PHP RFC: Migrating to GitHub Issues ======
  * Date: 2021-11-01
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to use GitHub Issues on the [[https://github.com/php/php-src|PHP repository]] in place of our own [[https://bugs.php.net/|bugs.php.net]] bug tracker.

Currently GitHub issues are already used for [[https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues|documentation issues]], as well as [[https://github.com/php/web-php/issues|website issues]] on the respective repositories. This RFC expands usage to the PHP implementation itself.

===== Motivation =====

The primary motivation for this change is that bugs.php.net has many known issues and is not actively maintained.

===== Setup on GitHub Issues =====

The issue tracker on GitHub will be located on the [[https://github.com/php/php-src|php/php-src repository]]. Using a custom issue configuration, creating an issue will display three possible options:

Bug reports and feature requests are filed on GitHub with custom issue forms. Security issues point to bugs.php.net instead, because GitHub currently does not support private issue reports. Additionally, we could add a fourth option for general questions that points to our [[https://www.php.net/support.php|support page]].

If the "bug report" option is chosen, the following form is displayed:

It requires an issue title, description and PHP version, and optionally accepts the used operating system. The description suggests (but does not require) to provide a script with actual and expected output. Additionally, the labels "bug" and "needs-triage" are automatically applied. 

The corresponding form for feature requests only accepts an issue title and description, as PHP version and operating system are usually not relevant in this case. The labels "feature" and "needs-triage" are automatically applied.

Issues labeled as "needs-triage" should be reviewed by a member of the php-src team to properly categorize them and check their validity (at least at a high level). When the issue is triaged, the "needs-triage" label is removed and replaced by one or more categorization labels. There are three sets of these:

  * "Extension: ext_name" correspond to bundled PHP extensions. For most extension-related issues, just adding the label for the corresponding extension is sufficient, e.g. "Extension: curl" for curl-related issues.
  * "SAPI: sapi_name" correspond to bundled SAPIs. These should be added if the issue directly related to the SAPI, e.g. "SAPI: fpm" should be used for FPM-related bugs. It should not be added if the reporter just happens to use this SAPI, but there is otherwise no direct relation.
  * "Category: category_name" exists for categories that correspond either to a subset of an extension (e.g. "Category: JIT") or represent cross-cutting concerns (e.g. "Category: Build System"). These might be applied in addition to or in place of an extension label.

The full set of initially proposed labels is given in the following, but additional labels can easily be added after the fact:

  * Extension: bcmath
  * Extension: bz2
  * Extension: calendar
  * Extension: com_dotnet
  * Extension: ctype
