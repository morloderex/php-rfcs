  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/parameter-no-type-variance

===== Introduction =====
PHP doesn't currently allow variance for parameters as checking these for compatibility isn't possible on compile time. This limitation is caused by autoloading and doesn't allow widening the accepted parameters.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to allow ommiting the type entirely in a subclass, as dropping all parameter constraints is always valid according to the LSP principle.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next minor version, currently 7.2.

===== RFC Impact =====

===== Open Issues =====

===== Future Scope =====

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

===== Patches and Tests =====
