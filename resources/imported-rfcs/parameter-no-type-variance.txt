====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-11-21
  * Author: Niklas Keller <me@kelunik.com>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/parameter-no-type-variance

===== Introduction =====
PHP doesn't currently allow variance for parameters as checking these for compatibility isn't possible on compile time. This limitation is caused by autoloading and doesn't allow widening the accepted parameters.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to allow ommiting the type entirely in a subclass, as dropping all parameter constraints is always valid according to the LSP principle.

==== Example ====

<code php>
<?php

class ArrayClass {
  public function foo(array $foo) { /* ... */ }
}

class IterableClass extends ArrayClass {
  // This implementation also accepts Traversable.
  // Variance is already possible in this special case using "iterable".
  public function foo(iterable $foo) { /* ... */ }
}

class EverythingClass extends ArrayClass {
  // This implementation accepts all values.
  // Restrictions may be done via user code in the method body.
  // Variance is currently not allowed, it throws a warning if parent or child miss a type.
  public function foo($foo) { /* ... */ }
}
</code>

**Current Result**

''Warning: Declaration of EverythingClass::foo($foo) should be compatible with ArrayClass::foo(array $foo) in %s on line 18''

**Proposed Result**

Compiles without a warning.
