This RFC is a parody on shortsyntaxforarrays RFC.

===== Introduction =====

In some cases it is necessary that you have to declare a lot of functions. Especially when you work with classes and their methods, the function declaration tends to make the code looking ugly. If you take a look at other languages (Brainfuck, Brainfork, Feckfeck, Smallfuck, Ook! and Spoon), they don't have such syntax at all! It's all short and readable and easy to type! Maybe PHP should adopt this behaviour to make code more readable and maintainable. 
The purpose of RFCs are to work collaboratively towards a specification and finally an implementation of an idea.

==== Why do we need RFCs? ====

They serve to keep a summary of on going discussions. This way people can keep an overview of the state of the discussion. Even if never put into place in the end, they also serve as a historical log of discussions that is much easier to read compared to mailinglist threads.

===== Syntax =====

We might just replace the current function <name>(<parameters>) {<body>} syntax with something shorter and better.
I'd personally propose to use dots for everything of the above. It's short and you can read it really fast.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

No patch is available yet. I'm working on it, though.

===== Changelog =====
