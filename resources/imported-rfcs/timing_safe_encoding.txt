===== Introduction =====

Cryptography libraries written in PHP often store encryption keys in an alternate encoding (Base-16 or Base-64, as specified in RFC 4648). However, the way these functions are trivially implemented open the door to possible cache-timing attacks which could be used to steal encryption keys, even if the encryption is well-implemented.

===== Proposal =====
A number of functions that already exist will have a timing-safe alternative exposed to PHP developers.

  * `bin2hex` -> `bin2hex_ts`
  * `hex2bin` -> `hex2bin_ts`
  * `base64_encode` -> `base64_encode_ts`
  * `base64_decode` -> `base64_decode_ts`

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None! :)

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This proposal targets the 7.0 release of PHP.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As this is not a significant change, a 50%+1 majority vote ought to be sufficient. 

===== Patches and Tests =====

An incomplete patch is being developed in [https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1036](Pull Request 1036).
