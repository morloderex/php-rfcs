===== Introduction =====

Cryptography libraries written in PHP often store encryption keys in an alternate encoding (Base-16 or Base-64, as specified in RFC 4648). However, the way these functions are trivially implemented open the door to possible cache-timing attacks which could be used to steal encryption keys, even if the encryption is well-implemented.

===== Proposal =====
A number of functions that already exist will have a timing-safe alternative exposed to PHP developers.

  * <code>bin2hex()</code> -> <code>bin2hex_ts()</code>
  * <code>hex2bin()</code> -> <code>hex2bin_ts()</code>
  * <code>base64_encode()</code> -> <code>base64_encode_ts()</code>
  * <code>base64_decode()</code> -> <code>base64_decode_ts()</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None! :)

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This proposal targets the 7.0 release of PHP. Or 7.1.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As this is not a significant change, a 50%+1 majority vote ought to be sufficient. 

===== Patches and Tests =====

An incomplete patch is being developed in [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1036|Pull Request 1036]].
