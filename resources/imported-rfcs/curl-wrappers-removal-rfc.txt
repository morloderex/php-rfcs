====== Request for Comments: Removal of curl-wrappers ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: April, 16th 2013
  * Author: Pierrick Charron <pierrick@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion


===== Introduction =====

This RFC is about removing the curl stream wrappers of the PHP as of 5.5 and to move it on PECL for any eventual improvements.

===== What this RFC is not about =====

This RFC is not about removing ext/curl from PHP.

===== What is the curl stream wrappers feature =====

The curl-stream-wrappers feature is a replacement for the php's stream implemenation, for fopen and other file_get_contents, not the curl_* functions.

===== Why should we remove it =====

  * This feature has been marked as experimental for years and never turned to stable
  * Most people using it just do so by accident 
  * This experimental feature should be moved in a new PECL extension for improvements until it gets stable

===== Patch =====
