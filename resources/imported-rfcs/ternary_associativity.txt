====== PHP RFC: Deprecate left-associative ternary operator ======
  * Date: 2019-04-09
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Target Version: PHP 7.4 and PHP 8.0
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4017

===== Introduction =====

Unlike most (all?) other languages, the ternary operator in PHP is left-associative rather than
right-associative. The left-associative behavior is generally not useful and confusing for
programmers who switch between different languages. This RFC proposes to deprecate and remove
left-associativity for the ternary operator and require explicit use of parentheses instead.

As an example, the code

<PHP>
return $a == 1 ? 'one'
     : $a == 2 ? 'two'
     : $a == 3 ? 'three'
     : $a == 4 ? 'four'
               : 'other';
</PHP>

would in most (all?) other languages be interpreted as

<PHP>
return $a == 1 ? 'one'
     : ($a == 2 ? 'two'
     : ($a == 3 ? 'three'
     : ($a == 4 ? 'four'
               : 'other')));
</PHP>

which is both the useful and intuitive interpretation. In PHP, it is instead interpreted as

<PHP>
return ((($a == 1 ? 'one'
     : $a == 2) ? 'two'
     : $a == 3) ? 'three'
     : $a == 4) ? 'four'
               : 'other';
</PHP>

which is generally not what was intended.

===== Proposal =====

In PHP 7.4 using nested ternaries without explicit parentheses will throw a deprecation warning.
In PHP 8.0 it will become a compile-time error instead.

<PHP>
1 ? 2 : 3 ? 4 : 5;   // deprecated
(1 ? 2 : 3) ? 4 : 5; // ok
1 ? 2 : (3 ? 4 : 5); // ok
</PHP>

This also applies when mixing short and long ternary syntax:

<PHP>
1 ?: 2 ? 3 : 4;   // deprecated
(1 ?: 2) ? 3 : 4; // ok
1 ?: (2 ? 3 : 4); // ok

1 ? 2 : 3 ?: 4;   // deprecated
(1 ? 2 : 3) ?: 4; // ok
1 ? 2 : (3 ?: 4); // ok
</PHP>

However, as an exception, explicit parenthesis are not required when combining two short ternaries:

<PHP>
1 ?: 2 ?: 3;   // ok
(1 ?: 2) ?: 3; // ok
1 ?: (2 ?: 3); // ok
</PHP>

The reason is that <php>($a ?: $b) ?: $c</php> and <php>$a ?: ($b ?: $c)</php> will always yield
the same result, even though the left-associative version will arrive at it in a less efficient
manner.

The null-coalesce operator ''??'' is already right-associative and not affected by these changes.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Code exploiting left-associativity of the ternary operator will become a hard error in PHP 8. As
left-associative ternaries are almost certainly bugs, the impact of this change should be minimal.

===== Future Scope =====

We could make the ternary right-associative, either directly in PHP 8 or at a later point in time,
after it has been an error for a while. Because the current left-associative interpretation is so
unlikely to be used intentionally, this is a viable change.

===== Vote =====

Straightforward Yes/No vote.
