====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2015-03-01
  * Author: Yasuo Ohgaki <yohgaki@ohgaki.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_function_names


===== Introduction =====

There are many functions that named before naming standard in CODING_STANDARDS. Therefore, PHP has function names like **phpversion()** and **htmlspecialchars**.

First of all, this RFC will not remove any old function names. This RFC only proposes renaming offending function names and have aliases for old names.

===== Proposal =====

There aren't much discussion about functions other than "string" and "array" related. Therefore, this RFC proposes multiple votes for 3 classes of functions.

  - Have CODING_STANDARDS names functions except "string" and "array" related.
  - Have CODING_STANDARDS names functions for "string" related also.
  - Have CODING_STANDARDS names functions for "array" related also.

**All of old function names are kept and exists forever** unless other RFC that proposes removal passes.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

  * New function names may have name collisions.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.0

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
All modules that have non standard names.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
All modules that have non standard names. e.g. GD

==== To Opcache ====

None

==== New Constants ====

None. Constant name is not subject of this RFC.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None. 

===== Open Issues =====


===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Class/Interface that has non standard names. e.g. __set_state

===== Future Scope =====

Class/Interface name/method name that has non standard names may be renamed.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Requires 50%+1 majority

  - Have CODING_STANDARDS names functions except "string" and "array" related.
  - Have CODING_STANDARDS names functions for "string" related also.
  - Have CODING_STANDARDS names functions for "array" related also.

===== Patches and Tests =====
