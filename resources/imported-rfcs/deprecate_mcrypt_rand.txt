====== PHP RFC: Deprecate MCRYPT_RAND ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-07-08 (use today's date here)
  * Author: Scott Arciszewski, scott@arciszewski.me
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_mcrypt_rand

===== Introduction =====
MCRYPT_RAND should be deprecated so that developers are discouraged from using it in production systems or in frameworks used by other developers. MCRYPT_RAND is a constant that instructs mcrypt_create_iv() to use a non-cryptographically-secure entropy source. While IVs do not have the same secrecy requirements as a private key, they should be unpredictable. Using MCRYPT_RAND is therefore unsuitable for cryptographic applications.


===== Proposal =====
The following changes should be made:
  * If MCRYPT_RAND is passed to mcrypt_create_iv(), an E_DEPRECATED error should be triggered.
  * In future versions, MCRYPT_RAND should be removed
  * With MCRYPT_RAND gone, mcrypt_create_iv() should transparently fall back to the default (currently MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM)

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Legacy code that uses MCRYPT_RAND explicitly will throw a deprecation notice. Down the road, the constant will be undefined.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This proposal should be considered for the PHP 5.7 (or 6.0 if that is to be the next version).
