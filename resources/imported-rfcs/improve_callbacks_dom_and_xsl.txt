====== PHP RFC: Improve callbacks in ext/dom and ext/xsl ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2023-11-05
  * Author: Niels Dossche, nielsdos@php.net
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

TODO

===== Proposal =====

TODO

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Strictly speaking, as the callable validity is checked earlier (i.e. when calling <php>registerPhpFunctions()</php>), this has a subtle break. If the function is not declared yet at the time of calling <php>registerPhpFunctions()</php>, then this will throw an error. Previously this was accepted as long as the function was declared by the time the callback was executed. I think however that this situation is sufficiently rare and easily avoidable.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 8.x" or "next PHP 8.x.y".

Next PHP 8.x, that is 8.4 at the time of writing.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To Existing Extensions ====

This affects both the ext/dom and ext/xsl extension.
Implementation-wise, the ext/dom extension will receive the shared code to deal with xpath callables because the result set handling already depends on DOM classes //and// ext/xsl depends on ext/dom.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything else, why does this section exist?

===== Future Scope =====

None right now.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

One primary vote requiring 2/3rd majority: accept the proposed changes?

===== Patches and Tests =====

TODO

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
