====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2020-04-05
  * Author: Max Semenik <maxsem.wiki@gmail.com>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/non-capturing_catches

===== Introduction =====
Currently, PHP requires to capture the exception being caught to a variable:
<code php>
try {
    foo();
} catch (SomeException $ex) {
    die($ex->getMessage());
}
</code>

However, you need to specify the variable even if it's not used:

<code php>
try {
    changeImportantData();
} catch (PermissionException $ex) {
    echo "You don't have permission to do this";
}
</code>

Someone reading the above code is left to wonder if the author intended to not use the exception variable or it's a bug.

===== Proposal =====
Allow catching exceptions without capturing them to variables:
<code php>
try {
    changeImportantData();
} catch (PermissionException) { // The intention is clear: exception details are irrelevant
    echo "You don't have permission to do this";
}
</code>
