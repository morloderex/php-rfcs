====== PHP RFC:  Cleaning up unmaintained extensions ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2016-08-07
  * Author: Stas Malyshev, stas@php.net
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
We have a number of SAPIs and extensions that have no assigned maintainer. The proposal is either to find a maintainer for them
or move them out of core. The RFC proposes the procedure for doing this for 7.1 release.

===== Proposal =====

For the extensions that have no maintainers, the proposal is to:
  - Issue a call for maintainership on internals list (and maybe other venues, as seen appropriate).
  - If a maintainer candidate(s) show up:
  -- If they are already committers, assign them as maintainers.
  -- Otherwise, ask them to submit a couple of patches for existing bugs in the extension, of their choice. If these are ok, issue them PHP account and assign them as maintainers. If extensions has no bugs to fix, assign them as maintainers immediately.
  - If within 3 weeks nobody steps up as a maintainer for extension, it is considered orphaned.
  - All orphaned extensions are converted to PECL modules and removed from core repository. 
  
The same is done for SAPI modules, unless it is clear the SAPI is widely used (like Apache, FCGI or CLI SAPI).

==== Candidate extensions ====
  * pdo_dblib

==== Candidate SAPIs ====

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Default build of PHP would not have the extensions that will be moved out. They still could be built from PECL sources.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

The process is proposed for 7.1. 

===== Future Scope =====

We may need to refresh the list of current maintainers (since some maintainers have moved on) and repeat the process
in the future.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

===== Patches and Tests =====

Depend on which extensions will be moved (if none, yay, all extensions are maintained now!)
