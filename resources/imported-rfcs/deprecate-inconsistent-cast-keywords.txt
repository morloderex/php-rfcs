====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2017-12-07
  * Author: Chris Wright <daverandom@php.net>

===== Introduction =====
Scalar type declarations use only a single name for each numeric type, but casts permit some variation. This RFC proposes to deprecate the variants that are not valid as type declarations for reasons of consistency.

===== Proposal =====
The following cast forms will emit ''E_DEPRECATED'' errors, with a schedule for removal to be agreed either during discussion of this RFC or in a subsequent RFC:

<code php>
(integer) // use (int)
(boolean) // use (bool)
(double)  // use (float)
(real)    // use (float)
</code>

The main reason for this is to help ensure that code is consistent and obviously readable.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Any code which uses these cast forms will now emit ''E_DEPRECATED'' errors. 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.3

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes/No, with a 2/3 majority required.

===== Patches and Tests =====
No implementation currently exists.

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs
