==== Rationale ====

Many template systems use PHP as its underlying language, so that the templates could be parsed and run by the efficient PHP engine, edited by PHP tools, benefit from PHP performance solutions, etc. PHP template can be written in two ways, with full tags:

<html>
This is a home page for <i><?php echo $user; ?></i>. 
Last visited at <?php echo $lastvisit; ?>. 
</html>

or short tags:

<html>
This is a home page for <i><?= $user ?></i>. 
Last visited at <?= $lastvisit ?>. 
</html>
