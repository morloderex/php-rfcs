====== PHP RFC: Use exceptions by default in SQLite3 extension ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2022-10-24
  * Author: BohwaZ, php at bohwaz dot net
  * Status: Under discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/sqlite3_exceptions


===== Introduction =====

The SQLite3 extension is still using PHP warnings by default. PDO is using exceptions, like everyone else.

It's time to move to exceptions.

===== Proposal =====

Progressively deprecate warnings (PHP 8.3), make exceptions the default (9.0) and remove warnings (10.0).

In PHP 8.3:

  * Create a new exception class ''SQLite3Exception'', which extends the ''Exception'' class
  * Remove SQLite3 error code from the error message, and assign it to the exception code
  * Make ''SQLite3::enableExceptions(true)'' throw SQLite3Exception instead of Exception
  * Calling ''SQLite3::enableExceptions(false)'' raises ''E_DEPRECATED''
  * Default behavior is still to raise warnings (''enableExceptions(false)'')

In PHP 9.0:

  * Make SQLite3 throw exceptions of class ''SQLite3Exception'' by default, instead of raising warnings
  * Calling ''SQLite3::enableExceptions(false)'' throws an error
  * It's not possible to use warnings anymore.
  * Calling ''SQLite3::enableExceptions(true)'' raises ''E_DEPRECATED'', to alert that the method will get removed

In PHP 10.0:

  * Remove the ''SQLite3::enableExceptions'' method

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

In PHP 8.3:

  * Code parsing the error message to get the error code may fail as the error code has been moved to be consistently at the end of the error message string. This is unlikely as the proper way is to use ''SQLite3::lastErrorCode()''.
  * Code already relying on exceptions will not see a difference, as previously \Exception was thrown, and \SQLite3Exception is a subclass of \Exception

In PHP 9.0:

  * Calls to SQLite3::enableExceptions(false) will break
  * Code relying on hiding warnings will break

In PHP 10.0:

  * Calls to ''SQLite3::enableExceptions()'' will fail

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.3, 9.0, 10.0

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Only SQLite3.

==== To Opcache ====

None that I can think of.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything outside of SQLite3 extension.

===== Future Scope =====

Assign SQLite3 error constants to SQLite3Exception class, eg. SQLite3Exception::READONLY, see https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * 1: accept proposal
  * 2: don't change anything

===== Patches and Tests =====

Pull request:

  * 8.3: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11058

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
