====== PHP RFC: PHP_XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE ======
  * Version: 0.9

===== Introduction =====

ext/xml allows the user to parse XML in an event-driven way (SAX). The user can register callbacks to be called when certain nodes are encountered while parsing. In a sense, this is a streaming parsing model.
This RFC attempts to address a feature request on the old bugtracker: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68325.

One important piece of background information is that the ext/xml extension can work with two XML parsers: either libexpat, or libxml2. The latter is the most commonly used one of the two. Since libxml2 2.7.6 parsing large inputs is opt-in instead of allowed by default. This is to protect against denial of service attacks. However, this broke a valid use-case of <php>xml_parse</php> and <php>xml_parse_into_struct</php>. Passing large documents to these methods now results in a parse error. There is a workaround for <php>xml_parse</php> by parsing in chunks, but this is a bit cumbersome if the data is already in memory anyway as you'll have to split the data into chunks. Ironically, this increases memory usage instead of preventing blowing up memory usage. For the latter method, that workaround does not work as you cannot use it with chunked parsing.

This proposal aims to solve these issues by introducing a new option.

===== Proposal =====

It's possible to set parser options via <php>xml_set_parser_option</php>. The idea is to add a new parser option that takes effect when libxml2 is used. The boolean option will be called <php>XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE</php>, so that will be a new integer constant added to the global namespace. The default value is <php>false</php> because that's the behaviour right now, and therefore will still protect against denial of service attacks in case of untrusted documents.

Internally, this option will pass XML_PARSE_HUGE to libxml2, allowing large documents to be parsed without resulting in a parse error.
If libexpat is used, this option will do nothing as libexpat does not block loading large documents anyway.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

No BC breaks unless the user defined a global constant XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE themselves.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

No changes.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

It only impacts ext/xml.

==== To Opcache ====

No changes.

==== New Constants ====

Adds a single integer constant to the global namespace: XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE ( = 5). Intended to be used only inside ext/xml.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

No changes.

===== Open Issues =====

None yet.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything outside of ext/xml.

===== Future Scope =====

None yet.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

One primary vote (requires 2/3 majority): add PHP_XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE?

===== Patches and Tests =====

Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12256

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
