====== PHP RFC: Fibers ======

===== Introduction =====
Fibers create full-stack, interruptible functions that may be used to implement cooperative concurrency in PHP. Unlike stack-less Generators, each Fiber contains a call stack, allowing them to be paused within deeply nested function calls. A function declaring an interruption point (calling ''Fiber::suspend()'') need not change its return type, unlike a function using ''yield'' which must return a ''Generator'' instance. Fibers pause the entire execution stack, so the direct caller of the function does not need to change how it handles the function.

Implementations of cooperative concurrency using promises suffer from the [[https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/|"What color is your function?"]] problem.   Once one function returns a promise somewhere in your call stack, the entire call stack needs to return a promise.

Fibers aim to solve this problem, allowing functions to be interruptible without polluting the entire call stack.

===== Proposal =====
<code php>
final class Fiber
{
    public const STATUS_INIT = 0;
    public const STATUS_SUSPENDED = 1;
    public const STATUS_RUNNING = 2;
    public const STATUS_FINISHED = 3;
    public const STATUS_DEAD = 4;

    /**
     * @param callable $callback Function to invoke when starting the Fiber.
     */
    public function __construct(callable $callback) { }

    /**
     * @return int One of the Fiber status constants.
     */
    public function getStatus(): int { }

    /**
     * Start the Fiber by invoking the callback given to the constructor with the given arguments.
     *
     * @param mixed ...$args
     *
     * @return mixed Value given to next {@see Fiber::suspend()} call or NULL.
     *
     * @throws Throwable If the fiber throws, the exception will be thrown from this call.
     */
    public function start(...$args) { }

    /**
     * @param mixed $value Value to return from {@see Fiber::suspend()}.
     *
     * @return mixed Value given to next {@see Fiber::suspend()} call or NULL.
     *
     * @throws Throwable If the fiber throws, the exception will be thrown from this call.
     */
    public function resume($value = null) { }

    /**
     * @param Throwable $exception Exception to throw from {@see Fiber::suspend()}.
     *
     * @return mixed Value given to next {@see Fiber::suspend()} call or NULL.
     *
     * @throws Throwable If the fiber throws, the exception will be thrown from this call.
     */
    public function throw(\Throwable $exception) { }

    /**
     * @return mixed Fiber return value.
     *
     * @throws Error If the fiber has not finished.
     */
    public function getReturn() { }

    /**
     * @param mixed $value Suspension value, returned from {@see Fiber::resume()} or {@see Fiber::throw()}.
     *
     * @return mixed Value given to {@see Fiber::resume()} when resuming the fiber.
     *
     * @throws Error Thrown if not within a Fiber context.
     */
    public static function suspend($value = null) { }
}
