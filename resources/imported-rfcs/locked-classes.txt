====== PHP RFC: Locked Classes ======
  * Version: 0.1

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

Object properties in PHP are primarily defined in class definitions; however, they can also be added to or removed from individual instances at any time. This RFC proposes an opt-in method for a class definition to disable this behaviour for all instances of that class.

While setting properties which were not declared in a class definition, or unsetting properties which were declared, can be a useful tool, like many of PHP's dynamic features, it also makes certain mistakes easier. For instance, if a class defines a property ''public $normalise=true;'', and a user writes ''$instance->normalize=false;'', a new property will be silently added. Static analysis can highlight this mistake, but the language itself issues no warning.

Changing this behaviour for all objects would be a significant change to the language, with the potential to break a large amount of existing code. However, code written with no intention of using this dynamic behaviour would benefit from a way to switch it off.

===== Proposal =====

A "locked" class is any class whose definition includes the modifier keyword "locked", regardless of any other modifiers. An instance of a locked class behaves like any other object, except that:

  * Attempting to set a property on the instance which was not declared in the class (or inherited from one of its parent classes) will throw an error, and the instance will not be modified.
  * Attempting to read a property on the instance which was not declared (or inherited) will throw an error, rather than raising a Notice and evaluating to ''null''.
  * Attempting to call ''unset()'' on any property of the instance will throw an error, and the instance will not be modified.

==== Interaction with Magic Methods ====

The existing "property overloading" magic methods (''%%__set%%'', ''%%__get%%'', and ''%%__unset%%'') may still be defined on locked classes, and will continue to be called in the same circumstances. Specifically:

  * If the class declares a magic ''%%__set%%'' method, this will still be called when attempting to set an undefined property instead of the error being thrown.
  * If the class declares a magic ''%%__get%%'' method, this will still be called when attempting to read an undefined property instead of the error being thrown.
  * If the class declares a magic ''%%__unset%%'' method, this will be called when attempting to unset //any property which is not declared in the class, or is declared private//. For properties which are declared and public, this magic method is not called; if the class is declared "locked", this case will therefore throw an error.

==== Interaction with Inheritance ====

The "locked" flag is **not** applied automatically to sub-classes. Any class may be marked "locked", regardless of whether it inherits from a locked class or not.

The rationale is that a sub-class can add any number of public properties not listed in the parent definition, or add magic methods; it would therefore be inconsistent to ban it from allowing dynamic properties.

If the author of the class wants to prevent this, the combination "final locked class" can be used to prohibit any child classes, whether locked or not.

===== Example =====

For more examples, see the tests included in the draft implementation.

<code php>
locked class TestClass {
    public $definedProp;
}

$t = new testClass();

// Defined properties work as normal
$t->definedProp = "OK";
echo $t->definedProp;
unset($t->definedProp);

// Undefined properties may not be read or written
echo $t->nonExistentProp; # ERROR: Cannot access undefined property $nonExistentProp on locked class TestClass
$t->nonExistentProp = "Not OK"; # ERROR: Cannot write undefined property $nonExistentProp on locked class TestClass

// Existing properties may not be unset
unset($t->definedProp); # ERROR: Cannot unset property $definedProp of locked class TestClass
</code>

===== Naming =====

Newer versions of ECMAScript / JavaScript have [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal|similar functionality, under the name "sealed objects"]]. However, the term "sealed class" has an unrelated meaning in languages such as Kotlin and C#, to do with limiting the class's participation in inheritance.

Since the proposed modifier applies to a class, not an instance, it would be confusing to use the keyword "sealed" in this sense, so the synonym "locked" has been chosen instead.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No internal classes, or classes in unmodified code, will change behaviour.

Since it is a new keyword, it will not be possible to "polyfill" this functionality, or declare a "locked class" in code which needs to be compatible with earlier PHP versions.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To Opcache ====
To be determined: are there any optimisations which interact with the behaviours being changed?

==== To Reflection ====

The following additions will be made to expose the new flag via reflection:

* New constant ReflectionClass::IS_LOCKED to expose the bit flag used for locked classes
* The return value of ReflectionClass::getModifiers() will have this bit set if the class being reflected is locked
* Reflection::getModifierNames() will include the string "locked" if this bit is set
* A new ReflectionClass::isLocked() method will allow directly checking if a class is locked

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====


===== Future Scope =====
TODO

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Should "locked classes" as described above be added to PHP 7.x? A 2/3 majority is required.
