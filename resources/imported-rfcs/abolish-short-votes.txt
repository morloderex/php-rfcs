====== PHP RFC: Abolish Short Votes ======
  * Version: 0.1

===== Introduction =====

Under the Voting section of the current [[rfc:voting:voting|Voting RFC]] it states:

<blockquote>The voting has minimal period of 1 week, which can be extended when circumstances warrant it.</blockquote>

The ambiguous language used here means that some contributors feel comfortable bringing big features to vote with only a one week period of voting.

At this point in the life of PHP, there is no good reason to squeeze a vote into a single week, our release schedule (and flexibility thereof) allows us to allocate two weeks for any vote.

===== Proposal =====

The above quoted text shall be removed from the Voting RFC and replaced with:

<blockquote>
Votes should be open for two weeks at minimum, at the authors discretion this may be extended, for example during holiday periods. 

A valid voting period must be declared when voting is started and must not be changed during the vote.
</blockquote>

Should this RFC pass, the version number of the Voting RFC shall be amended, the rest of the document shall remain unchanged.
