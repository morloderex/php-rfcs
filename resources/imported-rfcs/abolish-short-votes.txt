====== PHP RFC: Abolish Short Votes ======

===== Introduction =====

Under the Voting section of the current [[rfc:voting|Voting RFC]] it states:

<blockquote>The voting has minimal period of 1 week, which can be extended when circumstances warrant it.</blockquote>

The ambiguous language used here means that some contributors feel comfortable bringing big features to vote with only a one week period of voting.

===== Proposal =====

The quoted text should be removed from the Voting RFC and replaced with:

<blockquote>
Votes should be open for two weeks at minimum, at the authors discretion this may be extended, for example during holiday periods. 

The voting period must be declared when voting is started and must not be changed during the vote.
</blockquote>

===== Open Issues =====
N/A

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes/No
