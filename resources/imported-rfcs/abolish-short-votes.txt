====== PHP RFC: Abolish Short Votes ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-03-21 
  * Author: krakjoe
  * Status: Implemented
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/abolish-short-votes

===== Introduction =====

Under the Voting section of the current [[rfc:voting|Voting RFC]] it states:

<blockquote>The voting has minimal period of 1 week, which can be extended when circumstances warrant it.</blockquote>

The ambiguous language used here means that some contributors feel comfortable bringing big features to vote with only a one week period of voting.

At this point in the life of PHP, there is no good reason to squeeze a vote into a single week, our release schedule (and flexibility thereof) allows us to allocate two weeks for any vote.

===== Proposal =====

The above quoted text shall be removed from the Voting RFC and replaced with:

<blockquote>
Votes should be open for two weeks at minimum, at the authors discretion this may be extended, for example during holiday periods. 

A valid voting period must be declared when voting is started and must not be changed during the vote.
</blockquote>

Should this RFC pass, the version number of the Voting RFC shall be amended, the rest of the document shall remain unchanged.

===== Open Issues =====
N/A

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes/No

===== Vote =====

Voting started 5th April 2019, finishes 19th April 2019.
