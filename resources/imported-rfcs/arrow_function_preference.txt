===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this document is to help form a consensus on the final syntax for the [[rfc:arrow_functions|arrow functions RFC]]. Support for the feature has been indicated but there has been a lot of bike-shedding on syntax. I have narrowed this down to two syntax suggestions as outlined in an email to Internals; here it is [[https://gist.github.com/morrisonlevi/26a9a31281ff965046f51368a2fa3ff5|in gist form]].

The result of this vote is non-binding, meaning that voting here is not accepting something into the language. This is a way to express your preference of the two proposed syntaxes in voting form. The syntax represented of the voting choices are in the aforementioned email and gist. The result of this vote will be used to draft a final RFC targeting PHP 7.2
