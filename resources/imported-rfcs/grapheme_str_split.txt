===== Introduction =====
I noticed PHP does not have a grapheme cluster based str_split function. So I think need str_split for grapheme cluster, grapheme_str_split function using ICU. Creating this function in the Intl extension would provide stronger support for grapheme clusters. This feature will allow to correctly handle emoji and Variation Selectors.

grapheme_str_split function is correctly support for grapheme cluster.

<code>
$ sapi/cli/php -r 'var_dump(grapheme_str_split("üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"));'
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  string(13) "üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
}
</code>

For example, compare to mb_str_split function, mb_str_split function is str_split for Unicode codepoint. (Of course, sometimes this is more convenient.)

<code>
$ sapi/cli/php -r 'var_dump(mb_str_split("üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"));'
array(4) {
  [0]=>
  string(4) "üôá"
  [1]=>
  string(3) "‚Äç" // U+200D Zero Width Joinner
  [2]=>
  string(3) "‚ôÇ"
  [3]=>
  string(3) "Ô∏è" // U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR
}
</code>

Until now, PCRE functions were required to support grapheme clusters.

<code>
$ sapi/cli/php -r  'preg_match_all("/(\X)/u", "üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è", $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE); var_dump($matches[1]);'
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  array(2) {
    [0]=>
    string(13) "üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
    [1]=>
    int(0)
  }
}
</code>

===== Proposal =====
Add grapheme_str_split function.

<code>
function grapheme_str_split(string $string, int $length = 1): array|false {}
</code>

$string is only support UTF-8. $length is the length of the grapheme cluster per element of the array.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This could break a function existing in userland with the same name.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
next PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

To SAPIs Will add the aforementioned functions to all PHP environments.


==== To Existing Extensions ====

Add grapheme_str_split() to the intl extension.


==== To Opcache ====
No effect.

==== New Constants ====
No new constants.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
No changed php.ini settings.
