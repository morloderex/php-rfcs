 ====== Request for Comments: CLI option for "strict mode" ======

===== Introduction =====

This RFC seeks to add an option to the CLI SAPI that would enable the display of errors and the maximum level of error reporting.

===== Proposed Option =====

The proposed option would be ''-W'', with ''-''''-strict'' as the long form option. No argument would be accepted; this is a purely boolean option.

===== Why? =====

  * This makes debugging command line code easier, by providing a single option that can be turned on to make PHP maximally noisy.
  * Other languages have equivalents: Perl has ''-w'' (which doesn't enable ''use strict'', although I suspect most Perl users wish it did). Ruby also has ''-w''.

===== Why not? =====

  * Uses up another letter for something that's equivalent to ''php -d display_errors=1 -d error_reporting=-1''.

===== Patch =====

===== Changelog =====

  * 2011-07-05: Initial proposal.
