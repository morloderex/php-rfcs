====== Request for Comments: CLI options for strict and quiet modes ======

===== Introduction =====

This RFC seeks to add options to the CLI SAPI that would enable all and no error display.

===== Proposed Options =====

The proposed option to display all errors would be ''-W'', with ''-''''-strict'' as the long form option. No argument would be accepted; this is a purely boolean option.

Similarly, the option to hide all errors would be ''-Q'', with ''-''''-quiet'' as the long form option.

===== Why? =====

  * This makes debugging command line code easier, by providing a single option that can be turned on to make PHP maximally noisy.
  * Other languages have equivalents: Perl has ''-w'' (which doesn't enable ''use strict'', although I suspect most Perl users wish it did). Ruby also has ''-w''.

===== Why not? =====

  * Uses up another two letters for something that's equivalent to ''php -d display_errors=1 -d error_reporting=-1'' and ''php -d display_errors=0 -d error_reporting=0'', respectively.

===== Patches =====

  * v1.1 patch (''-W'' and ''-Q''): http://www.adamharvey.name/patches/php-cli-strict-quiet.patch.txt
  * v1.0 patch (''-W'' only): http://www.adamharvey.name/patches/php-cli-strict.patch.txt

===== Changelog =====

  * 2011-07-06: Add a ''-Q'' option in response to IRC and mailing list feedback.
  * 2011-07-05: Initial proposal.
