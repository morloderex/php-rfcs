====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2016-06-10
  * Author: Levi Morrison <levim@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/ReflectionTypeImprovements

===== Introduction =====
For PHP 7.0 the ''ReflectionType'' API was introduced in conjunction with [[rfc::return_types] | return types]]. Its minimal API was intended to be the base for future improvements; this RFC are those improvements.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC adds three new classes: ''ReflectionBuiltinType'', ''ReflectionSingularType'' and ''ReflectionClassType''. Both ''ReflectionSingularType'' and ''ReflectionClassType'' extend ''ReflectionBuiltinType'' which in turn extends ''ReflectionType''. Here it is in hierarchy form:

  - ReflectionType
    - ReflectionSingularType
      - ReflectionBuiltinType
      - ReflectionClassType

Here are their API

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== PHP Version =====
This RFC targets PHP 7.Next which is currently version 7.1.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
`ReflectionClass` is unaffected; this only touches `ReflectionType`.

===== Voting =====
This RFC proposes two votes. The first is for all of the backwards compatible improvements and the second is whether to break BC in ''__toString'' for nullable types to include ''?''.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
