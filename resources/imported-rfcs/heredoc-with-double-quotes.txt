==== Abstract ====
In 5_3 we introduced NOWDOC in and it would be logical to allow a double quoted syntax sister of NOWDOC which acts as HEREDOC (same as for $var = "$var" vs $var = '$var'). Currently we have the following options:

==== Code examples ====
=== Classic HEREDOC ===
<code php>
$var = "Hello world";

$str = <<<LABEL
$var
LABEL;
</code>
"$var" is evaluated

=== NOWDOC ===
<code php>
$str = <<<'LABEL'
$var
LABEL;
</code>
"$var" is taken literally

=== Proposed HEREDOC ===
<code php>
$var = 'Hello world';

$str = <<<"LABEL"
$var
LABEL;
</code>

"$var" would be intepreted.
