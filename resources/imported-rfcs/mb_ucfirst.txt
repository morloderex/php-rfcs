===== Introduction =====
PHP does not have a multibyte equivalent of ucfirst, lcfirst functions. It is possible to get close enough behavior below:

<code>
function mb_ucfirst(string $str, ?string $encoding = null): string
{
    return mb_strtoupper(mb_substr($str, 0, 1, $encoding), $encoding) . mb_substr($str, 1, null, $encoding);
}
</code>

<code>
function mb_lcfirst(string $str, ?string $encoding = null): string
{
    return mb_strtolower(mb_substr($str, 0, 1, $encoding), $encoding) . mb_substr($str, 1, null, $encoding);
}
</code>

However adding a pre-built functions to do this will implobe the readability and clarify of PHP code. And it will standardize how it is done as it can be tricky.

===== Proposal =====
Add mb_ucfirst function, mb_lcfirst function.


<code>
function mb_ucfirst(string $string, ?string $encoding = null): string
</code>

<code>
function mb_lcfirst(string $string, ?string $encoding = null): string
</code>

According to research about Unicode, some (natural) lanugage doesn't may expected behavior, please deal with it in userland if any wrong. Because (natural) languages is a lot of exists, it is difficult to deal in mbstring.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This could break a function existing in userland with the same name.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
next PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
To SAPIs Will add the aforementioned functions to all PHP environments.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Adds mb_ucfirst(), mb_lcfirst() to the mbstring extension.

==== To Opcache ====
No effect.

==== New Constants ====
No new constants.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
No changed php.ini settings.
