====== PHP RFC: Normalize array's "auto-increment" value on copy on write ======

===== Introduction =====

If two ''array''s are equal/identical, they should remain equal/identical ''array''s after
the same ''array_push(..., $val)'' call is executed on both of them:

<PHP>
assert($array1 === $array2); // identical/equal
$array1[] = $array2[] = 123;
assert($array1 === $array2); // still identical/equal
</PHP>

This is not currently guaranteed, and due to PHP's arrays nature, it is not possible to
always enforce this property -- but it should be at least in some dangerous cases.

When an ''array'' is assigned to a new reference, and it is copied, before a modification,
due to the copy-on-write behavior, it will result in an array that is identical in any way
to the original one; in fact, the copy also covers the "auto-increment" value:

<PHP>
$array1 = [0, 1, 2];
unset($array1[1], $array1[2]);

$array2 = $array1;
assert($array2 === [0]);
$array2[] = "push"; // triggers COW and then pushes the new entry

print_r($array2);
// Array
// (
//     [0] => 0
//     [3] => push
// )
</PHP>

This behavior happens, unfortunately, also between different scopes. Our code can receive
"broken" ''array''-lists from third-parties that only appear to be well-indexed
array-lists, but that in reality are not, because they were misused during their lifetime
(for example, it was used ''unset()'' on them, instead of ''array_pop()'').

As result of that, despite "copy on write", the value-type semantics, and even a different
scope, the following assertion can fail in some cases:

<PHP>
function test(array $array){
    if($array === [0, 1, 2]){
        $array[] = 3;
        assert($array === [0, 1, 2, 3]);
    }
}

// For example:
$poison = [0, 1, 2, 3];
unset($poison[3]);
test($poison);
</PHP>

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to reset the "auto-increment" value in copies triggered by "copy on
write", in order to guarantee a deterministic behavior to foreign scopes especially. The
"auto-increment" value of the new variable reference must be equivalent to the
"auto-increment" value that the array would have if it was re-created entry by entry,
as follows:

<PHP>
$array_copy = [];
foreach($array as $key => $value){
    $array_copy[$key] => $value;
}
</PHP>

The reset is not limited to new function scopes but any new by-value reference:

<PHP>
$array = [0, 1, 2, 3];
unset($array[3], $array[2]);
$arrayCopy = $array;
$arrayCopy[] = 2;
assert($arrayCopy === [0, 1, 2]); // this assertion must pass; it doesn't currently
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This change is not backward compatible; code relying on the next element index being
remembered between copies of copy-on-write will break. However, the proposed change
should be considered a bug-fix, rather than a behavior change. In fact, it offers
protection against ''array''-lists that were misused with ''unset()'' instead of
''array_pop/_splice/_shift''.
