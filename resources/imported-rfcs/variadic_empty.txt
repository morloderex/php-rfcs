  * Author: Thomas Punt, tpunt@hotmail.co.uk
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/variadic_empty

===== Introduction =====
This RFC aims to make the ''empty'' language construct accept any number of arguments.

<code php>
// example current usage #1:
if (empty($a) || empty($b) || empty($c)) {}

// example current usage #2:
if (!empty($a) && !empty($b) && !empty($c)) {}

// new example usage #1:
if (empty($a, $b, $c)) {}

// new example usage #2:
if (!empty($a, $b, $c)) {}
</code>

===== Proposal =====
By changing ''empty()'' to have a variable arity, we can write more compact code when checking for the emptiness of multiple expressions. This seems like a common scenario for web applications...

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No BC breakages.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.0
