===== Introduction =====

The [[rfc:return_types|Return Types]] RFC has introduced return types to PHP. While there is already a means to specify that any value may be returned (by omitting the return type), there is no means to specify that no value can be returned. This is unfortunate, as this can be useful for documentation and error-checking purposes. In particular, it makes it clear that a function performs an action, rather than producing a result. This RFC proposes the introduction of a ''void'' return type for this purpose.

===== Proposal =====

Support for a new ''void'' return type is added. It requires that a function not return any value:

<code php>
function should_return_nothing(): void {
    return 1; // error: should_return_nothing() must not return a value, integer returned
}
</code>

It accepts either an implicit return, or an explicit value-less return:

<code php>
function lacks_return(): void {
    // valid
}

function returns_nothing(): void {
    return; // valid
}
</code>

However, it does not accept returning a ''NULL'' value:

<code php>
function returns_null(): void {
    return NULL; // error: returns_null() must not return a value, null returned
}
function returns_null(): void {
    $x = some_computation(); // might produce null
    return $x; // error: returns_null() must not return a value, null returned
}
</code>

This is because, even though value-less and implicit return statements also ultimately return ''NULL'' to the caller, the intent of ''return NULL;'' is different to that of ''return;''. The former explicitly returns the value of ''NULL'', while the latter merely returns control flow.

The ''void'' type cannot be used for parameters:

<code php>
// compile-time error
function foobar(void $foo) {
}
</code>

For inheritance and interface conformance purposes, any typehint (including none whatsoever) is considered to be a superclass of ''void'', thus allowing methods returning ''void'' to be extended to return a value:

<code php>
class Foo
{
    public function bar(): void {
    }
}

class Bar
{
    public function bar(): array {
        // valid: array is considered a superclass of void
    }
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Like the scalar types proposed by the [[rfc:scalar_type_hints|Scalar Type Hints]] RFC, the ''void'' return type does not become a reserved word, but is instead restricted from use in class and interface names. This avoids confusion while minimising backwards-compatibility breakage.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This is proposed for the next major version of PHP, currently PHP 7.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. The vote is a straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC merging the patch.

===== Patches and Tests =====

There is currently no patch for either php-src or the language specification.

The patch will be based on patch used by the [[rfc:scalar_type_hints|Scalar Type Hints]] RFC, since it already contains the infrastructure for reserving class and interface names for parameter and return types. However, should that RFC fail to pass, it would be possible to base the patch directly on master.

[[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1080|This pull request]] is a prerequisite.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
