  * Author: Krzysztof Antczak <k.antczak@livedata.pl>
  * Status: In Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/class_properties_initialization

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this feature is to provide more advanced way to initialize class properties using closures, objects, type hinting.

==== Why do we need it? ====

  * **annotations**

===== Proposal =====

It's possible that this feature would be one of the best use with proposals: [[rfc:annotations]], [[rfc:returntypehint]] and [[rfc:enum]]

<code php>
class Foo
{
    private $var1 = new Bar();

    private $var2 = function () { /* some callback ? */ }

    private $var3 = array ( 'foo' => function () { /* some callback ? */ } );

    private httpRequest $var4 = NULL;
}
</code>
