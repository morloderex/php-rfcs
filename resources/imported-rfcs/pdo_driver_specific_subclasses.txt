====== PHP RFC: PDO driver specific sub-classes ======

===== Introduction =====

PDO is a generic database class. Some of the databases it supports have functionality that is specific to that database. For example, when connected to an SQLite database, the sqlite specific function PDO::sqliteCreateFunction is available.

Having methods exist on a class depending on how the program was compiled and/or what database it is connecting to is quite surprising. It would make the code be easier to reason about if there were subclasses of the PDO class, specific to each database that has specific functionality available.



===== Proposal =====

The proposal has three parts:

  * Add new subclasses of PDO
  * Add PDO::connect to be able to create them
  * Add DB specific function to those subclasses.

==== Add new subclasses of PDO ====

There will be one subclasse each for the SQLite and PGsql (aka Postgres) database drivers. PDOSqlite and PDOPostgres (or maybe PDOPgsql?).

Each of these subclasses will expose functionality that exists that is peculiar to that DB, and not present in the generic PDO class. e.g. PDOSqlite::createFunction() should be there rather than on the generic PDO class PDO::sqliteCreateFunction.

Although there may be DB specific functionality that could be exposed for the other database types that PDO support, this RFC does not intend to expose them.

==== Add a way of creating them through PDF static factory method ====

Add a static factory method to PDO called connect. During the connect process, the exact type of database being connected to will be checked, and if it is a DB that has a specific sub-class, return that sub-class instead of a generic PDO object

<code php>
class PDO
{
    public static function connect(string $dsn [, string $username [, string $password [, array $options ]]]) {

        if (connecting to SQLite DB) {
            return new PDOSqlite(...);
        }


        return new PDO(...);
    }
}
</code>

PDO::connect will return the appropriate sub-class when connecting to specific type of DB.

Users will also be able to create the DB specific classes directly, through the appropriate constructor e.g.

<code php>
$db = new PDOSqlite($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
</code>


The code will throw an exception if the type of database being connected to isn't of the correct type for the class.

==== Add DB specific function to those subclasses. ====



=== Postgres ===

These methods already exist as magic functions on PDO:

PDOPostgres::copyFromArray
PDOPostgres::copyFromFile
PDOPostgres::copyToArray
PDOPostgres::copyToFile
PDOPostgres::getNotify
PDOPostgres::getPid
PDOPostgres::LOBCreate
PDOPostgres::LOBOpen
PDOPostgres::LOBUnlink

=== SQLIte ===

These functions already exist as magic functions on PDO:

PDOSQLite::createAggregate
PDOSQLite::createCollation
PDOSQLite::createFunction

These will be two new methods

PDOSqlite::loadExtension
PDOSqlite::blobOpen


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None known. It might be inconvenient for people who are extending PDO class directly, and would like to extend the specific types. They would need to write their own connect functions, that wrap and proxy those specific types.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.2

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.


===== Open Issues =====

These are the known current issues.

==== Should the sub-classes only be avaiable when support for that DB is compiled in? ====

e.g. should PDOSqlite exist if PHP was compiled without PDO_SQLITE compilted in? Probaby not.

==== Create all DB sub-classes? ====

Should all DBs have sub-classes created now, or should they be added when someone requests it?

==== When to deprecate old function on PDO ====

The method PDO::sqliteCreateFunction should probably be deprecated and removed at 'some point'. Although this cleanup should happen, the position of this RFC is that it's very low priority.

8.2 - PDO subclassses become available 9.0 - calls to PDO::sqliteCreateFunction start raising deprecation notice. 10.0 - method PDO::sqliteCreateFunction is removed, and that functionality can only be accessed through PDOSqlite

Removing the methods that magically exist or not depending on the specific driver created would save some complication in the PDO code. So although there's not benefit in userland for deprecating the existing magic methods, there may be a complexity saving in maintenance.


==== PQescapeIdentifier ====

Postgres has a slightly different set of rules for escaping identifiers than it does for values and has a function `PQescapeIdentifier` to escape identifiers. Should this be exposed in the PDOPostgres class, or should PDO itself be capable of quoting values and identifiers separately?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything not PDO

===== Future Scope =====

This RFC does not propose adding subclasses for any other PDO database not listed above. 

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Accept the RFC or not.
