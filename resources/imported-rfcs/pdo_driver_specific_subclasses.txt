====== PHP RFC: PDO driver specific sub-classes ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2022-06-20 
  * Author: Danack
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses


===== Introduction =====

PDO is a generic database class. Some of the databases it supports have functionality that is specific to that database. For example, when connected to an SQLite database, the sqlite specific function PDO::sqliteCreateFunction is available.

Having methods exist on a class depending on how the program was compiled and/or what database it is connecting to is quite surprising. It would make the code be easier to reason about if there were subclasses of the PDO class, specific to each database that has specific functionality available.



===== Proposal =====

The proposal has two parts:

  * Add new subclasses of PDO with driver specific methods.
  * Add PDO::connect to be able to create the specific subclasses.


==== Add new subclasses of PDO ====

All of the PDO extensions that are part of the PHP src repository will have subclasses created for them.

Some of these subclasses will expose functionality that exists that is peculiar to that DB, and not present in the generic PDO class. e.g. PdoSqlite::createFunction() should be there rather than on the generic PDO class PDO::sqliteCreateFunction.

Although there may be DB specific functionality that could be exposed for the other database types that PDO supports, this RFC does not intend to expose them.

==== Add a way of creating them through PDO static factory method ====

Add a static factory method to PDO called connect. During the connect process, the exact type of database being connected to will be checked, and if it is a DB that has a specific sub-class (i.e. all of those extension that ship with PHP core), return that sub-class instead of a generic PDO object

<code php>
class PDO
{
    public static function connect(string $dsn [, string $username [, string $password [, array $options ]]]) {

        if (connecting to SQLite DB) {
            return new PdoSqlite(...);
        }


        return new PDO(...);
    }
}
</code>

PDO::connect will return the appropriate sub-class when connecting to specific type of DB.

Users will also be able to create the DB specific classes directly, through the appropriate constructor e.g.

<code php>
$db = new PdoSqlite($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
</code>


The code will throw an exception if the type of database being connected to isn't of the correct type for the class.


==== Sqlite Extension directory ini setting ====

The Sqlite3 extension requires users to set an ini setting to allow SQLite extensions to be loaded, presumably from a desire to keep things 'secure'. However, as this appears to only be a vulnerability if someone is able to upload and execute PHP code on a server, in which case the box is completely compromised any way, it doesn't seem to be necessary.

Additionally, in the proposed PdoSqlite class this code:

<code c>
sqlite3_db_config(db, SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION, 1);
</code>

is used to temporarily enable extension loading, before loading the extension, which only enables it through the C api, whereas the Sqlite3 extension uses the code:

<code c>
sqlite3_enable_load_extension(sqlite_handle, 1);
</code>

which affects both the C api and loading extensions through SQL code.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None known. It might be inconvenient for people who are extending PDO class directly, and would like to extend the specific types. They would need to write their own connect functions, that wrap and proxy those specific types.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.3

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.


===== Open Issues =====

These are the known current issues.


===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything not PDO

===== Frequently asked questions =====

==== if someone does 'new PDO(...)' will they now get back 'PdoPgsql' ==== 

No.

===== Future Scope =====

==== When to deprecate old function on PDO ====

The method PDO::sqliteCreateFunction and other driver specific methods should probably be deprecated and removed at 'some point'. Although this cleanup should happen, the position of this RFC is that it's very low priority, as that code has sat there for years not requiring much maintainance.

Removing the methods that magically exist or not depending on the specific driver created would save some complication in the PDO code. So although there's no benefit in userland for deprecating the existing magic methods, there may be a complexity saving in maintenance.

Choosing the version for them to be deprecated in can be left until the future.


==== Quoting identifiers ====

During the discussion, a point was raised that currently there is no "escape identifier" method on the base PDO class. Postgres at least has a specific method for escaping identifiers as the rules for escaping those are different from escaping values. It sounds valuable to add an escape method to the base PDO class, but that needs to be done by someone familiar with all of the database drivers.


==== SQLite constants ====

There are SQLite constants that are not currently exposed in the SQLite3 extension including:

  * SQLITE_DIRECTONLY
  * SQLITE_INNOCUOUS
  * SQLITE_SUBTYPE

I don't intend to add these as I don't understand them.

==== PdoSqlite aggregations, collations and functions ====

The code for these functions has been copied from the Sqlite3 extension. Although SQLite allows creating these with different flags to indicate what character set data should be in, the implementation is hard-coded to use the SQLITE_UTF8 flag.

It would be possible to expose, and allow users to set, the flags of SQLITE_UTF16, SQLITE_UTF16BE, SQLITE_UTF16LE, SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED, and SQLITE_UTF8, however what the API should look like for that is 'not obvious', aka I have no idea what it should be like, despite having thought about it for a few hours. So, I'm planning to leave it out of this RFC.


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Accept the RFC or not.

===== Patches and Tests =====

WIP code https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/8707


===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====

A proprosal to add [[rfc:implement_sqlite_openblob_in_pdo|sqlite openblob functionality]] previously failed to pass. The discussion gave the impression that the sub-classing [[ https://externals.io/message/100773#100813|approach would be more acceptable]].

===== Rejected Features =====

Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
