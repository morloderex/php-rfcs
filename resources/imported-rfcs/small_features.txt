===== Introduction =====
Currently we don't have a explicitly defined and agreed upon process for introducing small self contained features.
This RFC tries to address the common questions:
1, What do we consider to be a small, self-contained feature?
2, Do we need to have an RFC and vote even for the smalles features?
3, What version should the small features target?
