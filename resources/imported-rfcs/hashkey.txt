====== PHP RFC: __toKey magic method ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2014-10-22
  * Author: Joe Watkins
  * Status: Draft

===== Proposal =====
A new magic toKey method, to resolve the problem of not being able to use Objects as array keys.

<code php>
<?php
class Foo {
    public function __toKey() {
        return "Foo";
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();
$test = [
    $foo => true
];
</code>

Inheritance shall work as any other magic method:

<code php>
<?php
class Foo {
    public function __toKey() {
        return "Foo";
    }
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    /* shall use Foo::__toKey unless Bar::__toKey is implemented */
}

$bar = new Bar();
$test = [
    $bar => true
];
</code>

The current behaviour of __toString is unchanged.
