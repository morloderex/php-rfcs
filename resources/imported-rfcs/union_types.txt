===== Introduction =====
In PHP using "type hints" to define either the allowed parameter types for a function, or the return type of a function, performs two useful roles:

  * Using types allows the PHP engine to enforce the correct type of variable passed to, or returned from, a function.
  * Using types makes it easy to reason about what types need to be passed to, or can be returned from a function. This makes it easier for both humans, and static code analysis tools, to determine about whether code is correct or not.

For a lot of functions in PHP, each parameter will only be one type. Similarly, for the majority of functions, the return value of a function, will only ever be of one type.

However, for a significant number of functions, the acceptable parameters, or the possible return values, can be of more than one type. For example consider the ''stripos'' function where the return value varies based on:

  * if the needle exists it returns an integer.
  * if the needle is not found, false is returned.

In the documentation on php.net, the two possible return types are documented as ''mixed'' - however this does not actually document what the possible return types are, only that there is more than one possible type returned.

Currently in userland code, when a parameter for a function can be one of a multiple but limited set of types, or the return value from a function can be one of a multiple but limited set of types, there can be no type information supplied, and so it is not possible for the PHP engine to enforce any types passed to/from that function, and it is not easy for people using that function to reason about the types passed to/returned from that function.

This RFC seeks to address this limitation.

==== Proposal ====
This RFC proposes the ability to define multiple possible types for parameter and return types. To define a 'union type' a single vertical bar (OR) is placed between types e.g. ''int|bool'' represents the union type of either integer or boolean. For these 'union types' a value passes the type check if the value would pass any one of the types in the union. 

Additionally this RFC proposes that the values ''true'', ''false'' (see [[#truefalse|the "True/False" section]]) and ''null'' (equal to type ''null''; see [[#nullable_types|the "Nullable types" section]]) will be usable as types in both parameter types and return type definitions.

There can be more than two types in the union.

=== Parameter type examples ===
A function that requires either a string or an array is passed to it as the parameter:
<PHP>
function print_each(array | string $in) {
    foreach ((array) $in as $value) {
        echo $value, PHP_EOL;
    }
}
 
print_each(['Bob', 'Joe', 'Levi']); // ok
print_each('Levi'); // ok
print_each(new stdclass()); // TypeError
</PHP>
For this example, it is clear to both static analysis tools and humans that passing anything other than an array or a string to this function, would be an error. (or will be weakly cast to a string if strict_types are disabled, see also [[#weak_scalar_types|the "Weak Scalar Types" section]])

A class instance method that requires that either a string or a ParameterGenerator object is passed as the parameter.
<PHP>
// From zend-code
class MethodGenerator extends AbstractMemberGenerator {
     ...
    public function setParameter(ParameterGenerator|string $parameter) {
        ...
    }
}
</PHP>
For this example, it is clear to both static analysis tools and humans that passing anything other than a ParameterGenerator object or a string to this function, would be an error. 

=== Return type example ===
A userland definition of ''stripos'' function:

<PHP>
function stripos(string $haystack, string $needle, int $offset = 0): int|false {
    $lowerHaystack = strtolower($haystack);
    $lowerNeedle = strtolower($needle);
    return strpos($lowerHaystack, $lowerNeedle, $offset);
}
</PHP>
For this example, it is clear to both static analysis tools and humans this function can return either an integer or the value 'false', and so both cases need to be handled in the calling code.

==== Nullable types ====
To cover the common use-case of returning some type or ''null'', the ''null'' type needs to be permitted in a type declaration. The name is already reserved and the documentation already documents that ''null'' is both a type and a value. Previously it was not a helpful type declaration - if something is always passed ''null'' then there doesn't need to be a parameter at all, and if a function always returns ''null'' then there is no need to assign it. With the introduction of union types it becomes helpful and so this RFC proposes allowing ''null'' in unions:

<PHP>
function lookup_user(string $id): User | null;
</PHP>

This is currently possible via the short-hand nullable type support ''?Type''. However some concerns have been raised:

  - ''?Foo | Bar'' is pretty weird, it reads like "(nullable Foo) or (Bar)" when the nullability is not tied to a particular type.
  - Allowing ''Foo | null'' and ''?Foo'' is redundant.
  - ''Foo | null'' is more explicit than ''?Foo''. Users who are not familiar with ''?'' in other languages may understand the ''|'' better.

To address some of these issues this RFC disallows ''?'' being used in combination with union types. Thus ''Foo | Bar | null'' is allowed, but not ''?Foo | Bar''.

This RFC proposes a vote on whether ''?Foo'' shall be replaced by ''Foo | null'' in general.

==== True/False ====
It may be helpful to be able to explicitly use ''| false'' for return types as this is a common idiom in PHP's standard functions. As an example, the function signature for ''strpos'' could change:
<PHP>
// from
strpos ( string $haystack , mixed $needle [, int $offset = 0 ] ): mixed
// to
strpos ( string $haystack , mixed $needle [, int $offset = 0 ] ): int | false
</PHP>

This now allows to perfectly forward any internal signature and allows users to be more explicit.

Also ''false'' and ''true'' are not types in user-land, but they are internally.

This RFC proposes a vote to decide if ''true'' and ''false'' should be supported for unions.

==== Weak Scalar Types ====
=== Problem ===
PHP 7 allows weak scalar types. There is a question of how things will get converted in some situations when used in unions. As an example, if we have a union type of ''int'' and ''float'' and are passed the string "10" how is it converted?

<PHP>
function f(int | float $number) {
    return $number * 2;
}
f("10");
</PHP>

Would it be converted to ''int(10)'' or ''float(10)'', since either is acceptable? Does it matter given they are both acceptable?

=== Solution ===
Primarily, this issue is avoided if a parameter type exactly matches the input type or if PHP is in strict type mode.

With the only exception that an ''int(10)'' passed to a parameter requiring float as one of its types, but not ''int'' (e.g. ''string | float''), will be, in accordance with normal handling of integers passed to floats, coerced to ''float(10)''.

Otherwise PHP's casting rules are applied in an order to be as lossless as possible. PHP's weak-type casting rules are complex, which leads to a seemingly complex set of rules for casting types, however these rules are not an invention of this proposal. This RFC applies PHP casting rules in a sane way to convert a value to a type accepted by the union whenever possible.

^ Passed type ^ Argument type #1 ^ #2 ^ #3 ^ #4 ^
| object | string (''<nowiki>__toString()</nowiki>'') | - | - | - |
| boolean | long | double | string | - |
| long | double | string | boolean | - |
| double | long (exact match) | string | long | boolean |
| string | long/double<sup>†</sup> | boolean | - | - |
<sup>†</sup> only if actually numeric, the result of ''$str + 0''\\
Respecting the order, for each type check if it is available in the union, else throw a ''TypeError'' if none is available.

==== Variance ====
Return types are covariant: it is possible to remove types from the union in child functions.

Parameter types are contravariant: it is possible to add types to the union in child functions.

<PHP>
interface Foo {
    function pos(string $baz): int | false;
}
interface Bar extends Foo {
    function pos(string | Stringable $baz): int;
}
</PHP>

==== Reflection ====
This RFC proposes the addition of <php>ReflectionType::isUnion(): bool;</php> to check whether the type is an union type.

ReflectionType::__toString() will now provide a full union type as string; e.g. ''"int | float | NumberObject"''.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This RFC targets PHP version 7.1.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC requires that two-thirds of voters vote in favor of the RFC to pass.

Additionally, there are two 50%+1 votes:

  * on replacing ''?QuestionMarkNullables'' by ''union | null'',
  * and the true/false types (for unions only).

===== Patches and Tests =====
Bob Weinand and Joe Watkins have created a patch: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1887 which is needs some small polishing but implements the proposed features.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

==== Long Type Expressions ====
Since you can create a chain of types the names can get quite lengthy. Even the fairly short union type of ''Array | Traversable'' can be repetitive to type out. Should a mechanism to provide type aliases exist?

<PHP>
type Iterable = Array | Traversable;

function map(Callable $f, Iterable $input): Iterable {
    foreach ($input as $key => $value) {
        yield $key => $f($value);
    }
}

function filter(Callable $f, Iterable $input): Iterable {
    foreach ($input as $key => $value) {
        if ($value) {
            yield $key => $value;
        }
    }
}
</PHP>

It may also be advantageous for implementation reasons to define a type name for an expression.
