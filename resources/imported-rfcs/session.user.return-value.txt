====== PHP RFC: Fix handling of custom session handler return values ======

===== Introduction =====

The logic in ext/session/mod_user.c is just plain wrong.

http://us2.php.net/session_set_save_handler
   * "[For all callback functions] Return value is TRUE for success, FALSE for failure."
  
Yet in ext/session/mod_user.c:

   PS_FUNC(user) {
    /* blah blah */
    zval *retval = ps_call_handler(PSF(func), argc, argc);
    if (retval) {
       convert_to_long(retval);
       return Z_LVAL_P(retval);
    }
    return FAILURE;
  }
 
Remembering that SUCCESS == 0, and FAILURE == -1

So what does that mean for return values?
  * return false => return (int)false => return 0 => return SUCCESS
  * return true => return (int)true) => return 1 => return NeitherSUCCESSnorFAILURE

===== Proposal =====

Change the FINISH macro in session.c to map true to SUCCESS, false to FAILURE, warn (and fail) for integer -1, and warn (but succeed) for anything else.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

  * Anyone currently returning -1 for failure (because that's what ends up working as expected) now gets a warning.
  * Anyone returning false for failure now actually goes down the failure path (and this might be unexpected due to how long this has been wrong).

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Either 5.next (5.7?) or phpng due to the age of this bug.
