===== Introduction =====

Current session GC depends on probability. Thus, low traffic sites would not delete expired session data and could be usable as valid session. Traffic varies day and night time for high traffic sites. Chances are high that expired session may not be deleted as it should. 

The best way to purge old session data is executing GC periodically.

Although timestamp based session management is declined twice, it is mandatory for session management. Please refer to Strict Session RFC for details.
