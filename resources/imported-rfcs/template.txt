This RFC is a template other people can use to write their own RFCs.

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of RFCs are to work collaboratively towards a specification and finally an implementation of an idea.

==== Why do we need RFCs? ====

They serve to keep a summary of on going discussions. This way people can keep an overview of the state of the discussion. Even if never put into place in the end, they also serve as a historical log of discussions that is much easier to read compared to mailinglist threads.

===== Common Misconceptions =====

RFCs do not in any way replace discussions on the mailing list.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

Nothing needs to be patched here. Just use this template at your discretion.

==== Rejected Features ====

Automated voting system.
