====== PHP RFC: Deprecate and remove continue targeting switch ======
  * Date: 2018-06-24

  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/3323
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

In PHP, if continue is applied to a switch statement, it behaves the same as break. In other languages, it would continue the surrounding loop instead. To avoid confusion, this RFC proposes to deprecate and remove continues acting on switch.

The following example demonstrates the current behavior:

<code php>
while ($foo) {
    switch ($bar) {
        case "baz":
            continue; // In PHP: Behaves like "break;"
                      // In C: Behaves like "continue 2;"
    }
}
</code>

While ''continue'' and ''break'' are synonymous in this context, ''break'' is used almost exclusively, by convention and due to familiarity from other languages. Attempts to use ''continue'' are almost certainly attempts to achieve the behavior of ''continue 2'' by programmers who are not familiar with this PHP-ism.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to deprecate in PHP 7.3 and remove in PHP 8 the ability to target a switch statement through continue. This is no loss in functionality (it is always possible to replace the continue with a break), but avoids a gotcha for programmers coming from other languages.

The following illustrates cases which are deprecated and by what they can be replaced at various levels of loop nesting:

<code php>
switch ($foo) {
    case "bar":
        continue; // Deprecated
        break;    // Use this for equivalent behavior
}

while ($foo) {
    switch ($bar) {
        case "baz":
            continue;   // Deprecated
            break;      // Use this for equivalent behavior
            continue 2; // Or this for C-like behavior
    }
}

while ($foo) {
    switch ($bar) {
        case "baz":
            while ($xyz) {
                continue 2; // Deprecated
                break 2;    // Use this for equivalent behavior
                continue 3; // Or this for C-like behavior
            }
    }
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

PHP 7.3 throws additional deprecation warnings, PHP 8 generates a compile error. Fixing it is always trivial by replacing ''continue'' with ''break''.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Continue can still be used inside switch statements, as long as it does not target the switch.

===== Vote =====

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.
