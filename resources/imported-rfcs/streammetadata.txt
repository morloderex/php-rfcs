====== Request for Comments: How to write RFCs ======

====== Purpose ======

PHP file streams provide very powerful and useful abstraction layer over the I/O-related functions. However, there's a group of functions which are excluded from this support - namely, touch(), chmod(), chown() and chgrp() - i.e., functions dealing with file metadata. This lead to libraries implementing FS virtualization developing various hacks, such as here:
https://code.google.com/p/bovigo/wiki/vfsStreamDocsFilemode

The purpose of this RFC is to plug this hole by creating stream metadata API allowing to override these functions.
