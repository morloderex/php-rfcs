====== PHP RFC: Enumeration type, version 2 ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2020-05-14
  * Author: Max Semenik, maxsem.wiki@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/enum_v2

===== Introduction =====
The elevator pitch for the RFC. The first paragraph of this section will be slightly larger to give it emphasis; please write a good introduction.

===== Proposal =====
A simple enum:
<code php>
enum foo {
    a,          // Enum values start with 0 by default
    b,          // 1, always previous value +1 if not specified explicitly
    c = 10,     // Values can be set explicitly
    d,          // 11
    e = 1,      // Elements can duplicate each other
    f = 2 * 2,  // Can use the same expressions as constants
    g = f,      // Can use other elements
    h = g + 10, // And in expressions too
    H,          // Valid, element names are case sensitive
    i,          // Optional comma after the last element is allowed
}
</code>

===== Backwards Incompatible Changes =====
`enum` and `binary` will become reserved keywords.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 8.x (8.1?)

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This section details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
