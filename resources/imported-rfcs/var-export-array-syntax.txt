===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes to change var_export()'s array syntax to use the new short-hand arrays first introduced in PHP 5.4. The old array() construct is a kludge and is unappealing. The shorter syntax may be easier to read and takes up less space and is also more ubiquitous with JSON notation.

===== Proposal =====
Instead of <code php>array(1, 2, 3)</code> ''var_export()'' would produce <code php>[1, 2, 3]</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There shouldn't be any backwards incompatible changes as ''var_export()'' will continue to produce valid PHP code such that ''var_export()'' to PHP and PHP back to ''var_export()'' will continue to work as expected. The syntax changes are all forwards compatible as of PHP 5.4 so we shouldn't see any issues here.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.0

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None.

==== To Opcache ====
None.



===== Future Scope =====
None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
To vote will be to either change ''var_export()'''s array syntax to use the new short hand syntax or do not implement the change at all. I am not including an option to keep the old behavior, because I don't think it necessary. The change is forwards compatible and the old behavior should have zero effect on the outcome of the function's intent to produce valid PHP code. It is merely for aesthetics at that point.

===== Patches and Tests =====
The change only requires changing two lines in ''ext/standard/var.c'' (lines 530 and 540) to replace ''array ('' and '')'' with ''['' and '']''. See https://heap.space/xref/php-src/ext/standard/var.c?r=a9398056#530-540 for reference.
