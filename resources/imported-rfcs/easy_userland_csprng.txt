===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes adding a user-land API for an easy to use and reliable [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator|CSPRNG]] in PHP.

==== The Problem ====
By default PHP does not provide an easy mechanism for accessing cryptographically strong random numbers in user-land. Users have a few options like ''openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()'', ''mcrypt_create_iv()'' or directly opening ''/dev/*random'' devices to obtain high quality pseudo-random bytes, but unfortunately system support for these functions and extensions varies.

The ''mcrypt_create_iv()'' function is provided by the [[http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/|MCrypt lib]] which is solid, but unmaintained. Since it is built into PHP as an extension, it might not be enabled in certain environments (like most versions of PHP on Mac OS X). The longer this lib goes unmaintained, the more likely it is to have a security hole discovered that goes unfixed. And on top of all that, [[https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/564919926700658689|there is a bounty on MCrypt's head]]!

The ''openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()'' function is provided by the [[https://www.openssl.org/|OpenSSL lib]] which is being actively maintained but is hugely bloated and we've seen several major security issues pop up requiring the most-up-to-date version of the lib to stay secure. Moreover, in certain configurations, ''openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()'' will return bytes that are not cryptographically secure adding more required knowledge in user-land to ensure secure bytes.

Currently the most reliable way to grab pseudo-random bytes across systems is by using either of the libs mentioned above or falling back to a stream of bytes from ''/dev/urandom'' which is OS-specific and can fail when the ''open_basedir'' ini setting is set. This requires user-land apps to write potentially 100's of lines of code to simply generate pseudo-random bytes and there are several caveats that will not generate cryptographically secure bytes. And in some cases no reliable method can be found at all.

See the [[https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk-v4/tree/master/src/Facebook/PseudoRandomString|Facebook PHP SDK's implementation of a CSPRNG]] in PHP to understand how much code is needed in user-land to simply generate cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes.

===== Proposal =====
There should be a user-land API to easily return an arbitrary length of cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes directly and work on any supported server configuration or OS.

The initial proposal is to add **two** user-land functions that return the bytes as binary and integer.

<code php>
$randomStr = random_bytes($bytes = 16);

$randomInt = random_int($min = -PHP_INT_MAX, $max = PHP_INT_MAX);
</code>

The sources of random used are as follows:
  * On windows ''CryptGenRandom'' is used exclusively
  * ''arc4random_buf()'' is used if present for fd-less random
  * ''/dev/arandom'' is used where available
  * ''/dev/urandom'' is used where none of the above is available

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There would be no BC breaks.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
This RFC should not impact the SAPI's.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No existing extensions are affected.

==== To Opcache ====
Opcache is unaffected.

==== New Constants ====
There would be no new constants.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
There would be no new php.ini defaults.

===== Open Issues =====
  * Nothing yet

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This change does not affect any of the existing ''rand()'' or ''mt_rand()'' functionality.

===== Future Scope =====
The concepts from the RFC could be used to:

   * Deprecate ''mcrypt_create_iv()''
   * Improve ''session_id'' randomness generation
   * Detect LibreSSL portable for arc4random() on Linux
   * Improve fd-less random for chroot environments with our own arc4random and the linux ''getrandom'' syscall
