===== Introduction =====

This is a proposal to include a debugging platform in the distribution.

===== Proposal =====

Felipe Penna and I have recently developed a debugging platform for PHP, development continues ...

It could (should) be included in the distribution in the /sapi folder, it makes no changes to any other SAPI.

There will be a great benefit to everyone in having a debugger distributed with PHP.

Usually, the content of an RFC is used for the basis for documentation of a feature if it is merged; 

I ask in this case we make an exception, documenting the use of a debugger is a huge task, not suited for these pages.
We will of course write documentation, lots of it, in the manual should it be merged, in the mean time the brief documentation we have written is on phpdbg.com and will remain there whatever happens. 

This is a brief proposal to get the conversation started, I am busy ... anything you might want to know about the software can be read in source or on the phpdbg website.

If anything requires clarification, find me in the usual places ...

===== New Constants =====

In phpdbg the constants:

  - PHPDBG_METHOD 
  - PHPDBG_FUNC
  - PHPDBG_LINENO 
  - PHPDBG_FILE 

are registered, they are only available when executing in phpdbg

===== php.ini Defaults =====

None

===== Open Issues =====

None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

All

===== Changes to PHP =====

No actual changes were required, a patch to export more of the Zend API was already merged into 5.6+

I'd quite like to introduce the same patch to 5.5

http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=a0e3cb08e616a67d3eaddef665e27566a774ef78

This patch is only required for a build on Windows; where it requires exports because of the build system.

The phpdbg codebase is compatible with 5.4+
