====== PHP RFC: Unbundle ext/interbase ======

  * Version: 1.0.0
  * Date: 2019-03-22
  * Author: Kalle Sommer Nielsen <kalle@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate-and-remove-ext-interbase

===== Introduction =====

The InterBase extension for PHP (ext/interbase) is one of the oldest database extension who currently resides in the Core. The extension allow access to InterBase based database systems and Firebird based systems. A PDO extension exists for accessing the same database systems with a PDO backend, however for this RFC, only the ext/interbase extension is in question.

The InterBase extension was one of the few extensions that managed to continue its life in the 7.x series, however the extension lacks a maintainer and while there has been calls to taking over the extension, the volunteers who have stepped up have not kept it alive or even touched it. There is no one else around the Core with the experience and willingness to tackle this extension, meaning that the fixes we would be able to provide would be "blind" ones. Even in 7.x, the extension was not fully ported and may misbehave.

===== Proposal =====

Given the unacceptable nature of the status of this extension, I therefore propose to do the following:

=== 7.4 ===

Any function or alias called, which is exposed by ext/interbase, will emit a deprecation warning

=== 8.0 ===

The ext/interbase extension will cease to exist in php-src, and will be published on PECL without deprecation warnings

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Obviously, code using the interbase extension would issue deprecation warnings, and/or would have to use the PDO_Firebird extension in the Core in 8.0.

===== Open Issues =====

  * None

===== Voting =====

The primary vote is about whether to unbundle ext/interbase, which requires a 2/3 majority and will run for 2 weeks:
