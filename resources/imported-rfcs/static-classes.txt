===== Introduction =====
Static classes are a well known construct for utility classes or stateless abstraction. C# for example has an class System.Environment to access command line options, the current directory, the name of the machine where the program is running and so on. In PHP the current practice is to use an abstract class with static methods.
Static classes can act as utility containers. For such utility containers or for more complex static inheritance, static classes are a helpful tool. This is why they are proposed for PHP.

===== Syntax =====
<code php>
<?php
static class StaticClass
{
    public static function staticMethod()
    {}
}

abstract static class AbstractStaticClass
{
    abstract static public static abstractStaticMethod();
}
</code>
===== Object model rules =====
The following rules would apply for static classes:

  * Declared static classes **may not** have non-static members
  * Static methods in abstract static classes **may not** be called. They must be extended first
  * In static classes, abstract static methods **are allowed** again
  * Static classes **may not** have a constructor, destructor, dynamic interceptors or ''__toString()''
  * Static classes **may not** extend non-static classes
  * The current behaviour of abstract classes/non-static classes with static members **would not** change. This is important for backwards compatibility


===== Code =====
  * A few features missing, but initial functionality works: http://lars.schokokeks.org/php/static-classes-001.diff
