====== PHP RFC: Readonly classes ======
  * Date: 2021-08-04
  * Author: Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * Target Version: PHP 8.2
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7305

===== Introduction =====

PHP 8.1 added support for ''readonly'' properties via [[rfc:readonly_properties_v2|PHP RFC: Readonly properties 2.0]].

===== Proposal =====

The usage of the ''readonly'' modifier added by [[rfc:readonly_properties_v2|PHP RFC: Readonly properties 2.0]] is extended to classes:

<PHP>
readonly class Test {
    public string $prop;
}
</PHP>

Doing so will implicitly mark all typed instance properties of a class as readonly. Furthermore, it will prevent the usage of dynmacic properties.

==== Restrictions ====

A readonly class can only have typed properties.

As readonly static properties are [[rfc:readonly_properties_v2#restrictions|not yet supported]], readonly classes are forbidden to declare any static properties.

==== Inheritance ====

Similarly how overriding of readonly properties work, only a readonly class can extend a readonly class:

<PHP>
class A {}
readonly class B extends A {}
</PHP>

Both of the following are illegal:

<PHP>
readonly class A {}
class B extends A {}
</PHP>

<PHP>
class A {}
readonly class B extends A {}
</PHP>

==== Reflection ====

A ''ReflectionClass::isReadOnly()'' method is added, which reports whether a class is declared as read-only. ''ReflectionClass::getModifiers()'' will also report a ''ReflectionClass::IS_READONLY'' flag.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Vote =====

Add readonly classes as proposed?
