===== Introduction =====
A discussion whether it is feasible to add [[http://pecl.php.net/package/sync|sync]] PECL extension to the core.

===== Proposal =====

Providing the functionality of pecl_sync with the core distribution.

'sync' extension introduces synchronization objects into PHP. Named and unnamed Mutex, Semaphore, Event, and Reader-Writer objects provide OS-level synchronization on both *NIX (POSIX semaphores required) and Windows platforms.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP7, resp. git:master

===== RFC Impact =====

Classes that would become internal:
  * SyncMutex
  * SyncSemaphore
  * SyncEvent
  * SyncReaderWriter

===== Open Issues =====

  * pecl_sync has not been ported to PHPNG yet.
  * Possible class renaming (ie. SyncMutex => Mutex, SyncSemaphore => Semaphore, etc)
  * Documentation


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

A simple yes/no vote with a 50%+1 majority needed for acceptance.

===== Changelog =====

  * 1.0
    * Original draft
