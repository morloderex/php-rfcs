==== Introduction ====
This document describes the accessor syntax As Implemented.  The RFC which the implementation was crafted from is located here: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax

==== What Are Properties? ====

Properties provide a clean, easy to understand and unified syntax for get/set accessors.  They allow incoming and outgoing requests (gets and sets) from a class member to be run through a method first.  This method can perform validation or a transformation, or update other areas of the class.  Properties do not even have to be associated with a class member, and can generate their own data on-the-fly.


===== Syntax =====

==== Basic Syntax ====

This is the property syntax for accessors as implemented.

<code php>
class TimePeriod
{
    private $seconds;

    /* Accessor properties are implemented just like you would define an actual property */
    public $Hours {
        get { return $this->seconds / 3600; }
        
        /* In the set accessor, the variable $value holds the incoming value to be "set" */
        set { $this->seconds = $value * 3600; } 
    }
};
</code>

<code php>
// Accessing the property is the same as accessing a class member
$time = new TimePeriod();
$time->Hours = 12;  /* Stored as 43200 */
echo $time->Hours;  /* Outputs 12 */
</code>

Note that "get" and "set" were not made to be new keywords, they are processed as strings by the parser.
