  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/multiple-catch

===== Introduction =====

It is sometime required to duplicate code of a catch statement because two totally different types of Exceptions are handled the same way.

<code php>
<?php

try {
   // Some code...
} catch (ExceptionType1 $e) {
   // Code to handle the exception
} catch (ExceptionType2 $e) {
   // Same code to handle the exception
} catch (\Exception $e) {
   // ...
}
</code>

===== Proposal =====

This RFC introduce the possibility to catch multiple exceptions type in a single catch statement. It will avoid code duplication when similar code is reused across multiple exception types. The same thing could be done by implementing a common interface for ExceptionType1 and ExceptionType2 but you don't always have the control on exceptions structure if you're using external code.

<code php>
<?php

try {
   // Some code...
} catch (ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType2 $e) {
   // Code to handle the exception
} catch (\Exception $e) {
   // ...
}
</code>

This syntax and functionality is compatible with the Union RFC proposed here : https://wiki.php.net/rfc/union_types
