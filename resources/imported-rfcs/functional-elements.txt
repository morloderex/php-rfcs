====== Functional elements for object lists ======
==== Abstract ====
A common pattern in PHP is iterating through a list of objects and executing certain methods of the function. This is especially common when it comes to 1:n-relations (e.g. one object, n adapters). This proposal is meant to abstract those iterations in convenient functional constructs.

<code php>
foreach ($list as $element) {
    $element->method();
}

=== UC-2 ===
<code php>
$result = array();
foreach ($list as $element) {
    $result[] = $element->method();
}
</code>

=== UC-3 ===
<code php>
foreach ($list as $element) {
    if ($element->conditionalMethod()) {
        $element->method();
    }
}
</code>

=== UC-4 ===
<code php>
$result = array();
foreach ($list as $element) {
    if ($element->conditionalMethod()) {
        $result[] = $element->method();
    }
}
