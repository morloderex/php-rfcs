Replace PHP's current bench.php with a benchmark suite from which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== Introduction =====

PHP's current bench.php is a micro-benchmark which tests a number of language features. Since it does not behave like a 'real' application, it cannot provide meaningful information about the performance of PHP in general. This RFC will attempt to replace bench.php with a better suite of benchmarks, upon which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== What are we trying to measure =====

=== Performance impact of changes to PHP or its libraries ===

We need to be able to see how changes to the Zend engine affect real programs, not synthetic benchmarks.


=== Realistic profiling ===

We need realistic applications and workloads in order to get useful profiling info. Useful to know which pieces of the VM need optimization.

=== Performance improvement of other PHP implementations relative to PHP ===

There is a need for other PHP implementations to be able to measure their performance against the Zend engine.


===== What do we want in a benchmark =====

Benchmark applications should have few or no external dependencies, as it quickly becomes a major maintenance hell. Programs that use a DB should probably be changed to use a file-based engine like SQLite.

Basically we would like to see real-world apps tweaked so that automated deployment and testing is easy and simple. Each benchmark should also have a set of representative workload inputs (e.g. from real-world log files).

Benchmarks should be licensed under a liberal open-source license, so that they can be "safely" customized and redistributed for our needs.


===== What benchmarks currently exist =====

  * [[http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/ZendEngine2/bench.php?view=markup|Zend Engine's bench.php]]
    * The bench.php script just performs a few standard synthetic tests (e.g. ackermann, fibonacci, etc..). It also performs some tests on the areas that were optimized in Zend Engine 2 (so it's a little biased).
  * [[http://www.pureftpd.org/project/phpbench|PHPBench]]
    * It seems that this test really only tests language features, and doesnt actually do any work.
  * [[http://phplens.com/benchmark_suite/|PHP BS]]
    * only performs a few synthectic micro tests to compare different ways of doing the same. e.g. benchmark the usage of '$a += $b' vs '$a = $a + $b'
  * [[http://alioth.debian.org/scm/?group_id=30402|Debian Language Shootout]]
  * [[http://www.roadsend.com/home/index.php?pageID=benchmarks|Roadsend]]
    * Short, doesnt take command line parameters, is varied, but simple.
    * This seems to be the only test with data that needs to be run-through. This makes it a somewhat better test than the others, it seems.
  * [[http://www.spec.org/web2005/|SPECweb2005]]
    * very complete but very expensive
    * contains 3 applications: banking website, e-commerce website and a vendor support website
    * workload based on real data. more details at [[http://www.spec.org/web2005/docs/1.20/design/SPECweb2005_Design.html]]
    * Requires a number of machines: for DB, front-end and clients. Difficult to deploy. Results difficult to replicate for other developers.
    * This benchmarks the entire stack, not just PHP. If PHP is not the bottleneck, then the 'improvements' being tested will not appear. This can be an advantage - small improvements may not increase the speed of an web application in real life. However, it obscures what we are trying to measure - the speed of the PHP implementation.
  * [[http://jmob.objectweb.org/rubbos.html|RUBBoS: Bulletin Board Benchmark]]
    * Written in PHP 4 - no OO. Only minor changes required to make it run in PHP5.
    * Difficult to deploy. Requires at least 3 machines (it can be deployed on a single machine, but the results would be worthless).
    * Like SPECweb2005, the benchmarks the entire stack, not just PHP.
