Replace PHP's current bench.php with a benchmark suite from which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== Introduction =====

PHP's current bench.php is a micro-benchmark which tests a number of language features. Since it does not behave like a 'real' application, it cannot provide meaningful information about the performance of PHP in general. This RFC will attempt to replace bench.php with a better suite of benchmarks, upon which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== What are we trying to measure =====

=== Performance impact of changes to PHP or its libraries ===

We need to be able to see how changes to the Zend engine affect real programs, not synthetic benchmarks.


=== Performance improvement of other PHP implementations relative to PHP ===

There is a need for other PHP implementations to be able to measure their performance against the Zend engine.
