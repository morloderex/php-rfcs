Replace PHP's current //bench.php// with a benchmark suite from which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== Introduction =====

PHP's current bench.php is a micro-benchmark which tests a number of language features. Since it does not behave like a 'real' application, it cannot provide meaningful information about the performance of PHP in general. This RFC will attempt to replace bench.php with a better suite of benchmarks, upon which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== What are we trying to measure =====

=== Performance impact of changes to PHP or its libraries ===

We need to be able to see how changes to the Zend engine affect real programs, not synthetic benchmarks.


=== Realistic profiling ===

We need realistic applications and workloads in order to get useful profiling info. Useful to know which pieces of the VM need optimization.

=== Performance improvement of other PHP implementations relative to PHP ===

There is a need for other PHP implementations to be able to measure their performance against the Zend engine.


===== What do we want in a benchmark =====

Benchmark applications should be straightforward to deploy, preferably with no manual setup, even when multiple machines are required.
  * The benchmarks must be varied. We are not trying to measure features of PHP. We are trying to measure performance of applications.
  * preferably few or no external dependencies
  * It must be possible to separate results for the language, the database, the webserver and the benchmarking client.
  * DBs could possibly be changed to use a file-based engine like SQLite.
  * Web-apps benchmarks must have (real) data in order to simulate real work.

Basically we would like to see real-world apps tweaked so that automated deployment and testing is easy and simple. Each benchmark should also have a set of representative workload inputs (e.g. from real-world log files).

Benchmarks should be licensed under a liberal open-source license, so that they can be "safely" customized and redistributed for our needs.


===== The plan =====
**THIS IS NOT SET IN STONE - FEEDBACK ESPECIALLY NEEDED**

  * Start with something simple
    * Develop simple CLI benchmarks with the criteria "better than bench.php"
      * The best idea is probably to port existing javascript benchmarks (see bottom of page)
    * Tools to analyse and compare test runs.

  * Build a larger suite based on the infrastructure created from the first part
    * A suite of about 10 web-apps, which can be deployed and run in a straightforward manner
      * based on real world apps, with real world data

  * Integrate with build infrastructure
    * Automated summaries
    * Graphs over time
    * etc


===== What benchmarks currently exist =====

==== Microbenchmarks ====

  * [[http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/ZendEngine2/bench.php?view=markup|Zend Engine's bench.php]]
    * The bench.php script just performs a few standard synthetic tests (e.g. ackermann, fibonacci, etc..). It also performs some tests on the areas that were optimized in Zend Engine 2 (so it's a little biased). However, it doesn't perform any 'real' work.
    * There are many language features that it does not use, that might be used (perhaps sporadically) in a larger application:
      * OO
      * Variable-variables
      * Variable-function or -method calls (in fact, the call-graph is entirely static, and very shallow -- although there are at least cycles).
      * References
      * call-time pass-by-ref
      * dynamic function/class definition
      * eval
      * include (etc)
      * extract/compact

  * [[http://www.pureftpd.org/project/phpbench|PHPBench]]
    * It seems that this test really only tests language features, and doesnt actually do any work.

  * [[http://phplens.com/benchmark_suite/|PHP BS]]
    * only performs a few synthectic micro tests to compare different ways of doing the same. e.g. benchmark the usage of '$a += $b' vs '$a = $a + $b'

  * [[http://alioth.debian.org/scm/?group_id=30402|Debian Language Shootout]]
    * Provides a large number of small benchmarks
    * Tests OO, and references
    * Most of the benchmarks are very short (program length, not run-time) - the longest is 481 lines, and only 8 are longer than 100 lines.
    * Some tests come with input data

  * [[http://www.roadsend.com/home/index.php?pageID=benchmarks|Roadsend]]
    * Short, doesnt take command line parameters, is varied, but simple.
    * Many benchmarks are copied from the language shootout (old version thereof, apparently)
    * Some tests come with input data

==== Large benchmarks  ====

  * [[http://www.spec.org/web2005/|SPECweb2005]]
    * very complete but very expensive
    * contains 3 applications: banking website, e-commerce website and a vendor support website
    * workload based on real data. more details at [[http://www.spec.org/web2005/docs/1.20/design/SPECweb2005_Design.html]]
    * Requires a number of machines: for DB, front-end and clients. Difficult to deploy. Results difficult to replicate for other developers.
    * This benchmarks the entire stack, not just PHP. If PHP is not the bottleneck, then the 'improvements' being tested will not appear. This can be an advantage - small improvements may not increase the speed of an web application in real life. However, it obscures what we are trying to measure - the speed of the PHP implementation.
    * More information in paper: [[http://open.spec.org/workshops/2008/sanfrancisco/papers/Warner.doc|SPECweb2005®™ in the Real World: Using Internet Information Server (IIS) and PHP]] by Warner and Worley.


  * [[http://jmob.objectweb.org/rubbos.html|RUBBoS: Bulletin Board Benchmark]]
    * Written in PHP 4, with no OO. Only minor changes required to make it run in PHP5.
    * Difficult to deploy. Requires at least 3 machines (it can be deployed on a single machine, but the results would be worthless).
    * Like SPECweb2005, the benchmarks the entire stack, not just PHP.

  * [[http://linux.dell.com/dvdstore|Dell DVD Store Database Test Suite]]
    * Written in PHP 5. Has DB backends for MySQL, Oracle and SQLServer
    * TODO: take a closer look to see if it can be used

  * [[http://rubis.ow2.org/|RUBiS: Rice University Bidding System]]
    * An auction site application modeled after eBay.
    * Implementation variations in Java servlets and EJB are also available and compared in Middleware 2003 paper [[[http://rubis.ow2.org/download/Middleware-2003.pdf|Cecchet et al. 2003]]].

===== Applications which could make good web-app benchmarks =====

**Not much so far**

  * [[http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/|SugarCRM]]
    * A fairly large, production-quality, still [[http://www.sugarforge.org|open-sourced]] CRM application.
    * [[http://blogs.sun.com/vanga/entry/scaling_sugarcrm_with_mysql_on|An extensive benchmark experimentation is published]] as a blog entry at Sun Microsystems.

  * [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki|MediaWiki]]
    * A Wiki engine famous for its use in Wikipedia.
    * See [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.4_benchmarks|Benchmarking]] of it.

  * [[http://www.phpbb.com/|phpBB]]
    * One of the most popular BBS applications written in PHP.
    * [[http://www.php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=core%3abenchmarks|Phalanger uses it]] for demonstrating its performance advantage.

===== Applications which could make good CLI benchmarks =====

  * [[http://j4p5.sourceforge.net/|j4p5]]
    *  A Javascript interpreter written in PHP

  * [[http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/phuml.html|phuml]]
    * A tool for creating UML diagrams from PHP source
    * Not very useful if it is IO bound
    * Lots of data sets: can use any PHP package

  * [[http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/phpWhirl.html|phpWhirl]]
    * An odd language implementation
    * Uses 00
    * A small number of data sets (programs written in whirl)
      * [[http://www.bigzaphod.org/whirl/keymaker/quine.txt|A useful input]]

===== Porting other benchmark suites =====

  * V8: http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/benchmarks/
    * These will probably take a day each to port
    * The data sets are built into the applications
    * The sunspider ports are probably easier to work with

  * Sunspider: http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/
    * The data sets are (//I think//) built into the applications
    * The most useful benchmarks, in order, appear to be (includes V8 benchmarks):
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/v8-richards.js|Richards]] (V8)
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/v8-deltablue.js|Deltablue]] (V8)
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/v8-crypto.js|V8-Crypto]] (V8)
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/date-format-xparb.js|xparb]]
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/crypto-aes.js|Crypto-AES]]
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/crypto-md5.js|Crypto-MD5]]
      * [[http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/SunSpider/tests/3d-raytrace.js|3d-raytrace]] (ignoring the actual drawing from JS)

===== Benchmarking in other languages =====

* Python: http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/ProjectPlan#Performance

* Ruby: http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-benchmark-suite

===== Desired Benchmark Features =====

==== For command-line apps applications ====
  * Run-time
  * Memory usage
  * Hardware performance counters (if available), using PAPI
  * Simulated hardware statistics, using cachegrind
    * These should be combined into a single representative number, using some hardware model.
  * Ability to compare all of these over two runs
  * Support for other PHP implementations
  * Benchmark characterisation:
    * This is hard to do properly, so best to do it badly and give coarse grained information.

*TODO*

==== For web-apps ====

  * Requests per second
  * Memory usage
  * Bottleneck (is it scripting, DB, or network)
  * Total time for request
