Replace PHP's current bench.php with a benchmark suite from which meaningful performance measurements can be taken.

===== Introduction =====

PHP's current bench.php is a micro-benchmark which tests a number of language features. Since it does not behave like a 'real' application, it cannot provide meaningful information about the performance of PHP in general. This RFC will attempt to replace bench.php with a better suite of benchmarks, upon which performance measurements can be meaningful.
