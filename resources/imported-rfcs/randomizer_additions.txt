===== Introduction =====

This RFC extends the Randomizer class with two useful building blocks. 

With PHP 8.2, the new random extension was introduced. The new class is a great way to get random values, but currently it is not possible to create random strings from a given set of characters to generate a random string from this input alphabet. This function is useful as a building block, as many use cases require generating random strings with a specified list of characters (e.g. random passwords, voucher codes, numeric strings larger than integers) and implementing this in userland requires multiple lines of code for what effectively is a very simple operation. Furthermore the obvious implementation based on ->getInt() is inefficient, as it requires at least one call to the engine per character, whereas a 64 Bit engine could generate randomness for 8 characters at once.

Furthermore the new random extension has also no method to generate a random float number. This is also a non-trivial method to implement with pure PHP. So that is also a useful building block to implement within the class. 

===== Proposal =====

Add three new methods to <php>\Random\Randomizer</php>:

<PHP>
namespace Random;

final class Randomizer {
    // […]
    public function getBytesFromAlphabet(string $alphabet, int $length): string {}
    public function nextFloat(): float {}
    public function getFloat(float $min, float $max): float {}
}
</PHP>

==== getBytesFromAlphabet() ==== 

The method allows you to generate a string with a given length that consists of randomly selected bytes from a given alphabet. 

=== Parameters ===

<php>string $alphabet</php>

The alphabet from which random bytes are selected.

Note:

The alphabet may contain duplicate bytes. When bytes are duplicated the chance of a value being selected is equal to its proportion within the alphabet. If each byte only appears once, the bytes will be uniformly selected.

<php>int $length</php>

The length of the output string. 

=== Return Value ===

A random string with the length of the parameter <php>$length</php> containing only bytes from the parameter <php>$alphabet</php>.

=== Examples === 

**1. A random domain name.**

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

var_dump(sprintf(
    "%s.example.com",
    $randomizer->getBytesFromAlphabet('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789', 16)
)); // string(28) "xfhnr0z6ok5fdlbz.example.com"
</PHP>

**2. A numeric string that exceeds the range of 64 bit integers.**

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

// Note that leading zeros might be returned.
var_dump(
    $randomizer->getBytesFromAlphabet('0123456789', 30)
); // string(30) "217312509790167227890877670844"
</PHP>

**3. A random string where each character has a 75% chance of being 'a' and 25% chance of being 'b'.**

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

var_dump(
    $randomizer->getBytesFromAlphabet('aaab', 16)
); // string(16) "baabaaaaaaababaa"
</PHP>

**4. A random DNA sequence.**

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

var_dump(
    $randomizer->getBytesFromAlphabet('ACGT', 30)
); // string(30) "CGTAGATCGTTCTGATAGAAGCTAACGGTT"
</PHP>

==== nextFloat() ==== 

The method returns a float between 0 (including) and 1 (excluding). The returned values are uniformly selected and evenly distributed within the [0, 1) interval.

Evenly distributed means that each possible subinterval contains the same number of possible values as each other identically sized subinterval. As an example a return value less than <php>0.5</php> is equally likely as a return value that is at least <php>0.5</php>. A return value less than <php>0.1</php> will happen in 10% of the cases, as will a return value that is at least <php>0.9</php>.


=== Return Value ===

A random float, such that <php>$float >= 0 && $float < 1</php>.

=== Examples === 

**1. Simulate a coinflip:** 

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

var_dump(
    $randomizer->nextFloat() < 0.5
); // bool(true)
</PHP>

**2. Get true at a 10% chance:** 

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

var_dump(
    $randomizer->nextFloat() < 0.1
); // bool(false)
</PHP>

==== getFloat() ==== 

This method is equivalent to <php>->nextFloat()</php> for arbitrary ranges [$min, $max).

The algorithm used is the γ-section algorithm as published in: Drawing Random Floating-Point Numbers from an Interval. Frédéric Goualard, ACM Trans. Model. Comput. Simul., 32:3, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1145/3503512

=== Parameters ===

<php>float $min</php>

The lower bound of the half-open interval of possible return values.

<php>float $max</php>

The uper bound of the half-open interval of possible return values. The value <php>$max</php> will not be returned.

=== Return Value ===

A random float, such that <php>$float >= $min && $float < $max</php>.

=== Examples === 

**1. Generate a random latitude and longitude:** 

<PHP>
<?php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();

// Note that the latitude granularity is double the
// longitude's granularity.
//
// The $max (i.e. 90 and 180) will not be returned.
var_dump(sprintf(
    "Lat: %+.6f Lng: %+.6f",
    $randomizer->getFloat(-90, 90),
    $randomizer->getFloat(-180, 180),
)); // string(32) "Lat: -54.671066 Lng: +140.774953"
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None, since the current implementation of the Randomizer class is final and cannot be modified by the user. 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

None.

==== To Opcache ====

None.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

  * Shall an option be added to getFloat() that changes the logic to select from [$min, $max] (i.e. allowing the maximum to be returned)?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

The only affected functionality is the Randomizer class that receives new methods. These methods might be visible with Reflection. Everything else is unaffected.

===== Patches and Tests =====

  * Implementation of <php>getBytesFromAlphabet()</php>: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/9664
  * Implementation of <php>nextFloat()</php>: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/9679

These implementations are fully functional.
