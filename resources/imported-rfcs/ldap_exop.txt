===== Introduction =====
LDAP is a broad-use standard for storing information in a tree-style manner and access it efficiently.
It is especially famous for storing user accounts.
EXOP are extended operations which goes further than reading/writing LDAP nodes.
PHP have php-ldap module for connecting to an LDAP server and read/write datas but no way of doing EXOP operations.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC intends to add support for EXOP in php-ldap.
It is based on a patch for php-ldap which is more than 10 years old and we are trying to adapt it for current code base.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.2 if possible, 7.3/8 otherwise

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Will existing extensions be affected?

==== To Opcache ====
It is necessary to develop RFC's with opcache in mind, since opcache is a core extension distributed with PHP.

Please explain how you have verified your RFC's compatibility with opcache.

==== New Constants ====


===== Open Issues =====
  - Should the function names contain the word "exop" or is it a technical detail which should be hidden from the developer?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
All already existing ldap related methods stays the same. This RFC only adds new ones.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

State whether this project requires a 2/3 or 50%+1 majority (see [[voting]])

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
