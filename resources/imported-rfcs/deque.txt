===== Introduction =====

While ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' and its subclass ''SplQueue''/''SplStack'' exist in the SPL, they have several drawbacks (that are addressed by this RFC to add a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue|Deque]] class):

    - ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' is internally represented by a doubly linked list, making it use roughly twice as much memory as the proposed ''Deque''
    - ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' is an ''Iterator'', not an ''IteratorAggregate'', so different parts of the code can't independently iterate over the same ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' instance while iteration is in progress.
    - ''push''/''pop''/''unshift''/''shift'' from ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' are slower due to needing to allocate or free the linked list nodes.
    - Reading values in the middle of the ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' is proportional to the length of the list, due to needing to traverse the linked list nodes.
    - ''foreach'' iteration behavior cannot be understood without knowing what most recently constructed the ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' instance or set the flags.

It would be useful to have an efficient ''Deque'' container in the standard library to provide an alternative without those drawbacks, as well as for the following reasons: 

    - To provide a better alternative to ''SplDoublyLinkedList'', ''SplStack'', and ''SplQueue'' for use cases that require stacks or queues.
    - As a more efficient option than ''array'' and ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' as a queue or ''Deque'', for workflows requiring ''shift'' or ''unshift''.
    - To be able to reclaim memory in applications that run for long periods of time. Notably, PHP's ''array'' type will currently never release allocated capacity.


A ''Deque'' is more efficient than an ''array'' when used as a queue, more readable, and easier to use correctly. While it is possible to efficiently remove elements from the start of an ''array'' (in terms of insertion order), it is very inefficient to prepend elements to the start of a large ''array'' due to needing to either copy the array or move all elements in the internal array representation, and an ''array'' would use much more memory than a ''Deque'' when used that way (and be slower).

There are also several pitfalls to using an array as a queue for larger queue sizes,
some of which are not obvious and discovered while writing the benchmarks.
(Having a better (double-ended) queue datastructure (''Collections\Deque'') than the ''SplDoublyLinkedList''
would save users from needing to write code with these pitfalls):

    - ''array_key_first()'' takes time proportional to the number of elements ''unset'' from the start of an array, causing it to unexpectedly be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Table_of_common_time_complexities|extremely slow (linear to remove an element, and quadratic time to remove all elements)]] after unsetting many elements at the start of the queue. (when the array infrequently runs out of capacity, buckets are moved to the beginning of the array)
    - ''reset()'' also takes time proportional to the number of elements ''unset'' from the start of an array, taking longer if many elements are removed from the beginning of the array.
    - ''reset()'' or ''end()'' will convert a variable to a reference, adding some performance overhead and making opcache less efficient at optimizing uses of variables using references.
    - More obviously, ''array_unshift'' and ''array_shift'' will take time proportional to the number of elements in the array (to reindex and move existing/remaining elements) (linear time), compared to amortized constant time for ''Collections\Deque''.

 

===== Proposal =====
This proposes adding the class ''final class Collections\Deque'' to PHP. From [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue|the Wikipedia article for the Double-Ended Queue]]:

<blockquote>
In computer science, a **double-ended queue** (abbreviated to **deque**, pronounced deck, like "cheque") is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).

(omitted sections, see article)

The dynamic array approach uses a variant of a dynamic array that can grow from both ends, sometimes called array deques. These array deques **have all the properties of a dynamic array,** such as constant-time random access, good [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference|locality of reference]], and inefficient insertion/removal in the middle, **with the addition of amortized constant-time insertion/removal at both ends, instead of just one end.** Three common implementations include:

    - Storing deque contents in a circular buffer, and only resizing when the buffer becomes full. This decreases the frequency of resizings.
    - (omitted, see article)
</blockquote>

Similarly to deques in other languages (such as [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#deque-objects|Python collections.deque]], [[https://cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/|C++ std::deque]], [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html|Rust std::collections::VecDeque]], etc.) this is backed by a memory-efficient representation with good cache locality and provides constant amortized-time push/pop/shift/unshift operations. (this RFC's implementation is a circular buffer represented as a raw C array of values with a size, offset, and capacity)

This reclaims memory that is no longer used  (when less than a quarter of the capacity is used), unlike ''array''

Similarly to ''ArrayObject'' and ''SplDoublyLinkedList'', the ''$x[] = $value'' shorthand for appending to the ''Deque'' is supported in addition to ''ArrayAccess'' functionality.

The proposed API is:

<code php>
namespace Collections;

/**
 * A double-ended queue (Typically abbreviated as Deque, pronounced "deck", like "cheque")
 * represented internally as a circular buffer.
 *
 * This has much lower memory usage than SplDoublyLinkedList or its subclasses (SplStack, SplStack),
 * and operations are significantly faster than SplDoublyLinkedList.
 *
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue
 *
 * This supports amortized constant time pushing and popping onto the start (i.e. start, first)
 * or back (i.e. end, last) of the Deque.
 *
 * Method naming is based on https://www.php.net/spldoublylinkedlist
 * and on array_push/pop/unshift/shift/ and array_key_first/array_key_last.

    /**
     * Returns an iterator that accounts for calls to shift/unshift tracking the position of the start of the Deque.
     * Calls to shift/unshift will do the following:
     * - Increase/Decrease the value returned by the iterator's key()
     *   by the number of elements added/removed to/from the start of the Deque.
     *   (`$deque[$iteratorKey] === $iteratorValue` at the time the key and value are returned).
     * - Repeated calls to shift will cause valid() to return false if the iterator's
     *   position ends up before the start of the Deque at the time iteration resumes.
     * - They will not cause the remaining values to be iterated over more than once or skipped.

==== Iteration behavior ====



''Collections\Deque'' is an ''IteratorAggregate'' where ''getIterator'' returns an ''InternalIterator''. Different parts of the code can independently iterate through instances of the same ''Deque'' (e.g. nested for loops).

    * The value is the value found in the Deque at the time ''InternalIterator::current()'' is called. (or ''null'' if the iterator is invalid). (E.g. if you mutate the deque, you will see the new value when iterations such as ''foreach'' reach that value)
    * The key is the offset in the Deque at which the value would be found at the time ''InternalIterator::key()'' is called. (or null if the iterator is invalid)
    * ''shift'' or ''unshift'' changing the position of the start of the deque are accounted for - offsets in the deque won't be skipped or processed multiple times.
    * ''InternalIterator::valid()'' returns true if the InternalIterator's offset (computed from relative position to the start of the Deque) is within the Deque.
    * ''InternalIterator::next()'' unconditionally advances the InternalIterator's position.

[[https://tysonandre.github.io/php-rfc-demo/deque/|The Deque WebAssembly demo can be used to preview the behavior of iteration and other functions]]

<code php>
<?php
$deque = new Collections\Deque(['first', 'second', 'third']);
foreach ($deque as $offset => $value) {
    printf("value: %6s deque[offset=%s]=%s\n", $value, $offset, $deque[$offset]);
    if ($value === 'second') {
        printf("=> Shifting while iterating: removed %s\n", $deque->shift());
    } elseif ($value === 'third') {
        printf("=> Push while iterating\n");
        $deque->push('fourth');
    }
}
echo "\nAfter iteration\n";
var_dump($deque);
/*

value: second deque[offset=1]=second
=> Shifting while iterating: removed first
value:  third deque[offset=1]=third
=> Push while iterating

  [0]=>
  string(6) "second"

===== Arguments for adding this =====

==== What applications would benefit from Deque? ====

As mentioned in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)]]

<blockquote>
Queues provide services in computer science, transport, and operations research where various entities such as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be processed later. In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)|buffer]]. Another usage of queues is in the implementation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search|breadth-first search]].
</blockquote>

Some examples of how queues are used in php applications and libraries are below:

    - **Composer**: https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/2.1.8/src/Composer/DependencyResolver/RuleSetGenerator.php#L157-L203 uses a ''SplQueue'' internally as a work queue in its dependency resolution logic.
    - **Event-Driven frameworks**: https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop/blob/v1.2.0/src/Tick/FutureTickQueue.php uses ''SplQueue'' internally to hold callback functions to call later in the order they were added.
    - **Networking code**: [[https://github.com/predis/predis|Predis]], a userland client for the Redis database, currently uses SplQueue to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_pipelining|build a pipeline of commands and associate pipelined outgoing requests with their incoming responses]] in the order the requests were sent. https://github.com/predis/predis/blob/v1.1.7/src/Pipeline/Pipeline.php#L121-L150

Once applications and libraries such as those were able to use ''Collections\Deque'' (e.g. when the minimum PHP version requirement was raised), they would benefit from the speedup and reduced memory that ''Collections\Deque'' has over ''SplDoublyLinkedList''/''SplQueue''.

Looking at the [[#benchmarks]] section, ''SplQueue''(and the parent class ''SplDoublyLinkedList'') is typically slower than ''array'' (though ''array'' has higher reported memory usage). By introducing a data structure (''Deque'') that's even faster and uses less memory than an ''array'' for use as a double-ended queue, even more applications would benefit from it.

    * Additionally, ''Deque'' would allow some code to be refactored or written in a more readable way in cases where php developers would previously be avoiding using ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' (or ''SplStack''/''SplQueue'') due to older datastructures having time and memory usage inefficiencies.


https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splqueue.php#116422 is another example

<blockquote>
You can use shift/unshift and push/pop to dequeue/undequeue and queue/unqueue respectively. Really handy for those applications that use sockets where you might not know you can't send data until you attempt to.

for example, this is a function for an application that will un-dequeue the remainder of the data if socket_write indicated it did not write the entire contents of the provided data.

(omitted code snippet from https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splqueue.php#116422)
</blockquote>

Even users that don't write code using ''Deque'' may still benefit from its inclusion, due to improved performance and reduced memory usage in the applications and libraries that do adopt it.

==== Why use this instead of SplDoublyLinkedList? ====

    - Pushing/popping/shifting/unshifting takes roughly 30% less time.
    - ''Deque'' typically uses less memory than ''SplDoublyLinkedList''.
    - The iteration order is predictable, unlike ''SplDoublyLinkedList'', where it can be modified with flags
    - Constant-time access for reading or modifying elements at any position in the ''Deque'', unlike ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' where that would require walking the linked list.

==== Why use this instead of array? ====

    - Faster than using array for **queue-like** workloads (e.g. around 13%-37% less time to add to the end and remove from the start depending on ''Deque'' size and access pattern in an array implementation that **correctly** avoids linear-time operations).
    - It is impossible to prepend to an ''array'' (i.e. to be first in insertion order) in constant time. ''array_unshift'' takes time proportional to the length of an array.
    - ''Deque'' uses much less memory than an ''array'' **when used as a queue,** especially since that will eventually convert an array to an associative array. See https://www.npopov.com/2014/12/22/PHPs-new-hashtable-implementation.html and benchmarks. Note that starting in php 8.2, [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7491|arrays that are lists (with no/few gaps) are represented in a more memory efficient way than associative arrays.]]
    - Modifying an object by value can be faster than modifying an array by reference. Sometime, it is necessary for a library to modify a passed in collection/array in place (e.g. as an internal implementation detail) (e.g. appending to a list of errors and returning a boolean, converting a binary tree to a list of nodes where some predicate applies). The only way for a method to modify a passed in array parameter is by reference, and opcache is not able to optimize reference parameters/variables because their type at runtime cannot be guaranteed, passing in an object by value can be much faster than passing an ''array'' by reference. \\ \\ (Other approaches may end up copying arrays repeatedly, and take quadratic time instead of linear time, causing performance issues for large inputs). \\ \\ (Right now, some libraries do pass arrays by reference, because of how inefficient ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' is expected to be to create, modify, and read)

Also see [[#introduction|the RFC introduction]] for pitfalls with trying to use a PHP ''array'' like a queue.

=== Caveats ===

For stack-like workflows that only require pushing and popping from the end of a data structure, ''array'' uses roughly the same amount of memory as ''Deque'' and is faster than ''Deque'' due to [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7491|Use more compact representation for packed arrays.]] being merged into PHP 8.2

===== Usage =====

Examples of how each of these methods in ''Deque'' can be used can be found at https://www.php.net/spldoublylinkedlist - in most cases this can be used as a more efficient substitute for ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' (excluding relatively rare use cases such as removing from the middle of a ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' during iteration).

See [[#implementation|Implementation]] for the public API of ''Deque''.
 
===== Implementation Choices =====


==== "Collections\" namespace ====

This name was chosen in https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deque_straw_poll#arguments_foragainst_collections_deque  - this has a different enough implementation from ''SplQueue''/''SplDoublyLinkedList'' and other data structures in the spl that a different naming pattern or namespace made sense for future additions.

There has also been widespread interest in adopting namespaces for new modules/categories of functionality. https://wiki.php.net/rfc/namespaces_in_bundled_extensions recently passed and allows for using namespaces in new categories of functionality.

==== Accepting an iterable ====

This accepts the values of the iterable in the order of iteration. Keys of the ''iterable'' are ignored (Because this is meant to be a double-ended queue, adding placeholders would not make sense if there were gaps in the array.)

==== Final Class ====

If this were overridable, this would have the following drawbacks:

    - There would not be as strong guarantees to readers of PHP code using ''Deque'' (or even opcache, if optimizations were added targeting objects) that elements were actually a vector or that certain methods would/wouldn't throw certain exceptions, or that iteration would be possible. (if getIterator, ArrayAccess methods, etc. were overridable)
    - More memory and runtime checks would be required to check if this was the original class or a subclass when fetching a value
    - More memory would be required to mitigate any unexpected issues seen in the way subclasses overrid or used the base class.
    - [[https://bugs.php.net/search.php?search_for=SplFixedArray&boolean=0&limit=30&order_by=&direction=DESC&cmd=display&status=All&bug_type=All&project=All&php_os=&phpver=&cve_id=&assign=&author_email=&bug_age=0&bug_updated=0&commented_by=|There would be a larger chance the implementation would have discovered or undiscovered bugs]] due to userland subclasses of ''Deque'', in serialization/unserialization, reads or writes, resizing, future functionality added to PHP, opcache (if opcache optimizations were added), or future methods added to ''Deque'', or causes that were not even thought of yet.

Making all functionality ''final'' turns out to be the same approach that the PECL project https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds used for its datastructures. The php-ds's maintainers reasons are mentioned in https://medium.com/@rtheunissen/efficient-data-structures-for-php-7-9dda7af674cd and summarized or quoted below

    * "Prefer composition over inheritance"
    * "Inheritance would also introduce unnecessary internal complexity"
    * Avoid multiple methods doing the same thing (e.g. ''SplDeque'' has a redundant ''enqueue'' methods to add to the end of an array because the base class already had ''push()'')
    * "They are designed to be self-contained, much like an ''array''. You can't extend an ''array'', so we design our own APIs around it by using an internal ''array'' to store the actual data."

==== push/pop/shift/unshift (and first()/last()) ====

This is consistent with the name used for ''array_push()''/''array_pop()''/''array_shift()''/''array_unshift()''/''array_key_first()''/''array_key_last()'', as well as names used for ''SplDoublyLinkedList''

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The class name ''\Collections\Deque'' is now used by PHP, and it will be a compilation error to declare classlikes of the same name in the namespace ''Collections'' since the class already exists.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.2

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Opcache ====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
PHP's type system remains unchanged (e.g. ''array'') - ''final class Collections\Deque'' is a class, and instances of ''Collections\Deque'' are ordinary objects.

===== Benchmarks =====

==== Two cycles of appending n values then shifting them from the start ====

Note that it is possible to have constant time removal from the start of a PHP ''array'' efficiently (as long as ''key'' stays at the start of the array), but it is not possible to have constant time prepending (`unshift`) to the start of an array. ''array_unshift'' is a linear time operation (takes time proportional to the current array size).
So ''unshift'' is not included in these benchmarks.

Because there's a second cycle in this benchmark, array becomes an associative array and uses more memory than a packed array (https://www.npopov.com/2014/12/22/PHPs-new-hashtable-implementation.html). (At the time of writing, a packed array uses double the memory of a ''Deque'', though there is an unrelated change in review proposing reducing the memory usage of packed arrays). 

memory_get_usage is not counting the memory overhead of tracking the allocations of a lot of small objects, so the memory usage of ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' is under-reported. ''SplQueue'' is a subclass of ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' and I expect it would have the same performance.

''Deque'' and ''array'' both always capacities that are powers of 2. This benchmark tests the best-case memory usage for ''Deque'' and ''array''

**''Deque'' is faster than ''SplDoublyLinkedList'' at all sizes, and faster than ''array'' at medium and large sizes. The maximum memory usage is also noticeably lower than both ''array'' and ''SplDoublyLinkedList''**

Caveats for comparison with [https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds](Ds\Deque PECL):

    * Ds\Deque was compiled and installed as a shared extension with ''phpize; ./configure; make install'' (shared reflects the default way to install PECL modules, e.g. what pecl install or an OS package manager would do or what copying the windows DLL would do), not statically compiled into php
    * Both Deque and Ds\Deque use circular buffers, so the performance is expected to be about the same.
    * This php-src PR has micro-optimizations such as storing the mask (instead of capacity) for faster bitwise ands, as well as the use of the EXPECTED/UNEXPECTED macros to hint the fast path to the compiler.
    * Having the extra step of installing a PECL may discourage application/library authors from writing code using a PECL or discourage some users from using those applications/libraries. While php-ds has a polyfill, the polyfill would be slower than native solutions - https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds#compatibility

==== Only appending to a Deque and reading elements without removal ====

Note that the proposed ''Deque'' as well as the existing ''SplDoublyLinkedList''/''SplStack'' are expected to perform equally well at shifting to (adding to) or unshifting from(removing from) the start(first elements) of an array. (Shifting or unshifting (or unsetting) the start is inefficient for arrays)

**For this benchmark, Deque can be created and read from faster than the fastest methods of reading ''SplStack'' or ''SplFixedArray''.**

    * Note that a ''foreach'' is used instead of random access for ''SplStack'', since ''SplStack'' random access time is proportional to the number of linked list nodes that need to be iterated over to read a value.
    * ''SplFixedArray'' would be faster to append to if it had a ''push()'' method, but there isn't one.

Major notes:

    * ''Collections\Deque'' and ''SplFixedArray'' use less memory than other available options.
    * ''Collections\Deque'' is faster than object data structures currently available in the SPL.
    * In php 8.2+, ''array'' is faster than all object data structures, and memory usage of large packed arrays is half of what would be used in 8.1 due to https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7491

===== Future Scope =====

If ''Collections\Deque'' is added, there would be plenty of time for myself or others to propose and discuss additional methods before PHP 8.2's feature freeze (probably in July 2022) (e.g. ''insert(int $offset, mixed ...$values)'', ''remove(int $offset)'')

Future additions to https://github.com/TysonAndre/pecl-teds that are general purpose enough such as hash sets/maps and sorted sets/maps and vectors may be possible as well.

===== Rejected Features =====

==== Why not use php-ds/ext-ds instead? ====

    - No matter how useful or popular a PECL is, datastructures available in PHP's core will have much, much wider adoption in applications and libraries that are available in PECLs, allowing those applications and libraries to write faster and/or more memory efficient code.
    - End users can make much stronger assumptions about the backwards compatibility and long-term availability of data structures that are included in core.
    - The php-ds maintainers do not plan to merge the extension into php-src, and believe php-ds should coexist with new functionality being added in a separate namespace instead (see quote and [[##updatephp-ds_maintainer_response_clarifications|later clarifications]] for full context)
    - Opcache may be able to make stronger optimizations of internal classes found in php-src than any third party PECL. (e.g. because ''Collections\Deque::push()'' or ''Collections\Vector::push()'' would never throw or emit notices, it may be possible to optimize it to be even faster than appending to an array in the Opcache JIT compiler)

=== php-ds maintainer response ===

This has been asked about multiple times in threads on unrelated proposals (https://externals.io/message/112639#112641 and https://externals.io/message/93301#93301 years ago) throughout the years.

The php-ds's maintainer's position is that "we should start from scratch and borrow whatever is good from php-ds that we want to keep to implement something natively in core."

Hi everyone, I am happy to see this discussion and I thank you all for taking part. My reservation to merge ds into core has always been because I wanted to make sure we get it right before we do that and the intention behind the mythical v2 was to achieve that, based on learnings from v1 and feedback from the community. I have no personal attachment to this project, I only want what is best for PHP and the community.

I would love to see a dedicated, super-lean vec data structure in core that has native iteration and all the other same internal benefits as arrays. In my opinion, the API should be very minimal and potentially compatible with all the non-assoc array functions. An OO interface can easily be designed around that. I'm imagining something similar to Golang's slices.

As for the future of ds itself, I think these can co-exist and ds can remain external. I've been researching and designing immutable data structures over the last 4 years and I still hope to develop a v2 that simplifies the interfaces and introduces immutable structures. Attempting to implement a suite of structures in core or an OO vector would take a lot of work and might be difficult to reach consensus on with the API. I don't think we should attempt to merge ds into core at any time.

I am currently traveling and have not followed this discussion in detail on the mailing list. I'd be happy to assist in any way I can and will catch up as soon as I am home again this week. Feel free to quote this response on the mailing list as well.

=== Minor differences in API design goals ===

Traditionally, PHP has been a very batteries included language. Existing functionality such as [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php|strings]] and [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php|arrays]] have very large standard libraries. This makes it easier to write code without depending on too many third party composer libraries, and knowledge of the standard library can transfer to any codebase a developer works on.

My hopes for ease of use, readability, speed, and static analysis in future data structures such as ''Vector'' are similar to those mentioned by [[https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds/issues/156#issuecomment-752179461|Benjamin Morel in the GitHub issue]]:

<blockquote>
<blockquote>Functions like map, filter, reduce can be delegated to other libraries that operate on iterable instead of having these as first-class members of the interface.</blockquote>

Again, I understand the rationale behind this decision, like reducing duplication and keeping only the core functionality in DS. However, sometimes you have to take into consideration ease of use vs purity of the code.

Ease of use / DX / readability: it seems more logical to me to do:

''$map->filter(fn(...) => ...);''

Rather than:

''Some\filter($map, fn(...) => ...);''

Speed: as you said, internal iteration is faster. And speed is one of the selling points of DS vs arrays.

Static analysis: I love the fact that ''Map::filter()'' can be strictly typed as returning ''Map<TKey, TValue>'' in Psalm, for example. If you rely on a generic ''filter()'' function, I'm not sure such strict typing will be easy or even possible.

Thank you for your work on DS anyway, I already use the extension in my closed-source project, in particular Map. I would love to use data structures in my open-source projects, one day! 🤞
</blockquote>

Additionally, it may be inconvenient for end users (e.g. new contributors to projects) to remember specifics of multiple libraries or utility classes when working on different codebases, to deal with dependency conflicts after major version upgrades, or to deal with libraries dropping support for older php versions, getting abandoned, etc.

I'm still awaiting some clarifications on how they they were willing to assist before updating the remainder of this RFC.

Additionally, there may be differences in design goals, as noted in the above section.

===== Changelog =====

   * 0.2: Link to definition of Deque.
   * 0.3: Add php-ds maintainer's response clarifications
   * 0.4: Update benchmarks after https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7491 memory and time optimizations for packed arrays were merged into PHP 8.2
   * 0.5: Change proposed iteration behavior to iterate over the original Deque rather than a copy, having the Deque account for shift/unshift modifying the position of the start of the array (to avoid iterating over elements too many/few times if the front of the internal representation changes position). Update benchmark result. Update responses from php-ds maintainers.
   * 0.6: Rename to ''Collections\Deque''
   * 0.6.1: Update section for rationale on namespace choice. Link to WebAssembly demo.
   * 0.6.2: Update benchmarks code/results after iteration implementation change in 0.5.
   * 0.7.0: Remove get()/set() helpers due to overlap with offsetGet/offsetSet functionality - introduction of typed get()/set() was suggested as better suited for a separate proposal for all data structures.
   * 0.8.0: Change bottom()/top() to first()/last()
