====== PHP RFC: get_debug_type ======
  * Version: 1
  * Date: 2020-02-15
  * Author: Mark Randall, marandall@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/get_debug_type

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to add a new function get_debug_type that will return the given type of a variable.

This function would differ from gettype in that it would return native type names, e.g. "int" rather than "integer" and would automatically resolve class names.

  * 0 => int -- (gettype: integer)
  * 0.1 => float -- (gettype: double)
  * true => bool --  (gettype: boolean)
  * false => bool -- (gettype: boolean)
  * "hello" => string  
  * [] => array  
  * null => null -- (gettype: NULL)
  * A class with name "Foo\Bar" => foo\bar -- (gettype: object)
  * An anonymous class => class@anonymous -- (gettype: object)
  * A resource => resource (xxx) -- (gettype: resource)
  * A closed resource => resource (closed)

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.0

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes / no vote on adding the new function.

(Optional) A vote on the name, if there is not a clear majority consensus during RFC discussion.
