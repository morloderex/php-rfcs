====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2023-12-04
  * Author: Derick Rethans <derick@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/policy-repository

===== Introduction =====

Currently, policies in regard to RFC Voting, the Release Process, security classification, and naming guidelines are all recorded in different places. In RFCs, through amending RFCs (think "Abolish Short Votes"), etc. This makes it sometimes hard to find out what is [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/121919|expected]], and how things are supposed to be.

===== Proposal =====

This proposal suggests to set up a new Git repository to collect all the policies that we have. RFCs to add or amend to policy would then target additions or modification of the documents in this repository, instead of having them just as RFC text.

Similarly, the canonical security classification will move from https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/SECURITY.md to https://github.com/php/policies/blob/main/security-classification.rst, with the former explaining how to file security issues only instead.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

As this is not for a specific PHP version, it is not targeting one either.


===== Open Issues =====

- Should the historical information be moved out of release-process to a dedicated file?

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Do we want all the policies in one place in a Git repository?
2/3rds majority required.

===== Patches and Tests =====

A preliminary repository has been set up at https://github.com/php/policies
