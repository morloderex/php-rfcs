====== PHP RFC: Policy Repository ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2023-12-04
  * Author: Derick Rethans <derick@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/policy-repository

===== Introduction =====

Currently, policies in regard to RFC Voting, the Release Process, security classification, and naming guidelines are all recorded in different places. In RFCs, through amending RFCs (think "Abolish Short Votes"), etc. This makes it sometimes hard to find out what is [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/121919|expected]], and how things are supposed to be.

===== Proposal =====

This proposal suggests to set up a new Git repository to collect all the policies that we have. RFCs to add or amend to policy would then target additions or modification of the documents in this repository, instead of having them just as RFC text.

Similarly, the canonical security classification will move from https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/SECURITY.md to the new repository, with the former explaining how to file security issues only instead.

Changes to the policy repository should only be made through a new RFC, unless it is for fixing spelling mistakes or grammar.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

As this is not for a specific PHP version, it is not targeting one either.

===== Next Steps =====

Once (and if) this RFC is accepted, a first new step would be to rephrase the text so that it reads like a policy document, instead of an RFC. The wording is currently exactly as in the used RFCs, without modification.

===== Backwards Compatibility Breaks =====

None in code, but [[rfc:release_cycle_update|PHP RFC: Release cycle update]] needs to be partially redone to work with this new policy repository.

===== Open Issues =====

  * Should the historical information in "release process" be moved out of release-process to a dedicated file?

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Do we want all the policies in one place in a Git repository?
2/3rds majority required.

===== Patches and Tests =====

A preliminary repository has been set up at https://github.com/php/policies
