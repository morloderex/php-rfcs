  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2021-07-22
  * Author: Nicolas Grekas, nicolasgrekas@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7259
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_intersection_types

===== Introduction =====
Intersection types as currently accepted for PHP 8.1 are not nullable. This RFC proposes to make them so.

===== Proposal =====
TBD

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.1.

===== Future Scope =====
See https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pure-intersection-types#future_scope

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As per the voting RFC, the first question requires a 2/3 majority for this proposal to be accepted:

  * Make intersection types nullable: yes / no
  * Preferred syntax: "?" prefix / "|null" suffix
  * If "?" wins, brackets should be: mandatory "?(Y&Y)" / not needed "?X&Y" / both styles should work
  * If "|null" wins, brackets should be: mandatory "(Y&Y)|null" / not needed "X&Y|null" / both styles should work

===== Patches and Tests =====
See https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7259

Patch will be updated according to the syntax decided by vote.
