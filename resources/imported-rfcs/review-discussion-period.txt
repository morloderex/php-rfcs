====== PHP RFC: Review Discussion Period ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-04-06 
  * Author: krakjoe
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/review-discussion-period

===== Introduction =====

This RFC seeks to review the "Discussion Period" section of the [[rfc:voting|voting]] RFC, quoted here:

<blockquote>
There'd be a minimum of 2 weeks between when an RFC that touches the language is brought up on this list and when it's voted on is required. Other RFCs might use a smaller timeframe, but it should be at least a week. The effective date will not be when the RFC was published on the PHP wiki - but when it was announced on internals@lists.php.net, by the author, with the intention of voting on it. This period can be extended when circumstances warrant it - such as major conferences, key people being busy, force major events, or when discussion merits it - but should never be less than minimal time.

This does not preclude discussion on the merits on any idea or proposal on the list without formally submitting it as a proposal, but the discussion time is measured only since the formal discussion announcement as described above.
</blockquote>

The following problems exist:

  * Language ambiguity - we already removed the words "language feature" from other parts of the document
  * Minimum discussion periods are not well defined

===== Proposal =====

The "Discussion Period" section shall be removed and replaced with:

<blockquote>
The discussion period commences when the author of the RFC posts the non-draft document to internals as described in the "Proposal Initiation" section of this document.

The discussion period must last a minimum of one week, extended as necessary and at the authors discretion.

Proposals that are moved to the voting stage too quickly are likely to receive negative votes; It is in the authors best interest to resolve all points brought up during discussion before moving to a vote.

A proposal in discussion phase that has not had received any input on internals (from the author or otherwise) for the period of one calendar month shall be considered stale: Stale proposals must be re-initiated as per the "Proposal Initiation" section of this document, restarting the discussion period.
</blockquote>
