===== Introduction =====

This RFC seeks to review the "Discussion Period" section of the voting RFC, the following problems exist:

  * Language ambiguity - we already removed the words "language feature" from other parts of the document
  * Minimum discussion periods are not well defined
  * We do not deal with stale RFC's

===== Proposal =====

The discussion period section shall be removed and replaced with:

<blockquote>
The discussion period commences when the author of the RFC first posts the non-draft document to internals as described in the "Proposal Initiation" section of this document.

The discussion period must last a minimum of one week, extended as necessary and at the authors discretion.
</blockquote>
