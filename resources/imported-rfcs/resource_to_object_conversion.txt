====== Resource to object conversion ======

===== Introduction =====

Resources are a legacy data structure which were superseded by objects a long time ago. They have quite a few disadvantages like the inability of using ''resource'' type declarations, lack of garbage collection (they have to be explicitly freed), bad feedback about memory leaks, etc.

As far as I know, Nikita was the first one who realized these shortcomings and started converting resources to objects, [[rfc:operator_overloading_gmp#proposal_bgmp_improvements|''GMP'' back in 2013]], [[https://externals.io/message/104361#104361|''XMLParser'' in 2019]]. However, this ambitious project only got traction during the release cycle of PHP 8 where dozens of extension were refactored so that they started to use objects instead of resources ([[https://github.com/php/php-tasks/issues/6|tracker ticket]]). At the time of writing, only around 7 built-in extensions remain which still expose resources...

===== Discussion =====

As eliminating resources altogether should be a strategic goal for PHP, this time, the question is not whether the remaining resources should be converted to objects or not, but the timeline when we can do so, in order to have acceptable level of backward compatibility breaks.

Usually, the biggest complaint against these kind of changes is due to return value changes of ''is_resource()'' invocations (read [[https://externals.io/message/116127#116176|a long thread about this topic here]]). An example of such situation along with a suggested fix:

<code php>
$pipes = [];
$process = proc_open("sleep 1", [], $pipes);
if (is_resource($process)) {                  // the condition yields false after conversion happens
    ...
}

if ($process !== false) {                     // this is the backward compliant way to check for success
    ...
}
</code>

Most often, these issues are easy to spot and fix, but admittedly needs some careful manual work. Therefore, the goal of this RFC is to set the rules according to which the project can continue. So far, the vast majority of the individual conversions were "unofficial", meaning they didn't have to go through the formal RFC process, there was no deprecation period (it is not really feasible anyway), and were performed even in minor versions. I do believe this kind of flexibility has been beneficial for the overall project, however, we occasionally get complaints due to the above mentioned BC breaks. That's what this RFC should prevent for future conversions.

The resources yet to be migrated can be categorized the following way based on their backward compatibility impact:

==== Process resource ====

The ''Process'' resource is returned by ''proc_open()''. According to my earlier [[rfc:process_object_name|straw poll]], its new class name is going to be ''ProcessHandle'' once the migration takes place.

==== Stream-related resources (primary and auxilliary) ====

There are a number of stream-related resources which are to be converted: first of all, the most important ones are ''stream'' and ''persistent stream'' themselves. Historically, these have always been the most widely used resources in the whole PHP ecosystem, since the file handling API is (mostly) organized around them.

Furthermore, streams have some auxiliary resources:
  * stream context: it stores parameters/options for the different stream wrappers
  * stream filter: it helps perform operations on streams
  * userfilter.bucket, userfilter.bucket brigade: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27103269/what-is-a-bucket-brigade|a very detailed explanation, written by Bob]]

==== Other resources ====

The rest of the built-in extensions which currently expose resources are the following:

  * COM
    * com_dotnet_istream_wrapper
    * com_dotnet_dispatch_wrapper
  * DBA
    * dba: connection resource returned by ''dba_open()''
    * dba persistent: persistent connection resource  returned by ''dba_popen()''
  * ODBC
    * odbc link: connection resource returned by ''odbc_connect()''
    * odbc link persistent: persistent connection returned by ''odbc_pconnect()''
    * odbc result: result resources returned by various ''odbc_*'' functions
  * SOAP
    * SOAP SDL: ''SoapClient::$sdl''
    * SOAP table: ''SoapClient::$typemap''
    * SOAP URL: ''SoapClient::$httpurl''

===== Vote =====

The RFC consists of 4 votes, one for each resource category (two for stream-related resources). Since the majority of the resource migrations in question don't yet have an implementation, the voting choices are intentionally left vague so that they only define whether a resource group can only be migrated in a major version or the conversion can happen in minor versions as well.
