====== Resource to object conversion ======

===== Introduction =====

Resources are a legacy data structure which were deprecated by objects a long time ago. They have quite a few disadvantages like the inability of using ''resource'' type declarations, lack of garbage collection (they have to be explicitly freed), bad feedback about memory leaks, etc.

As far as I know, Nikita was the first one who realized these shortcomings and started converting resources to objects, [[rfc:operator_overloading_gmp#proposal_bgmp_improvements|''GMP'' back in 2013]], [[https://externals.io/message/104361#104361|''XMLParser'' in 2019]]. However, this ambitious project only got traction during the release cycle of PHP 8 where dozens of extension were refactored so that they started to use objects instead of resources (a [[https://github.com/php/php-tasks/issues/6|tracker ticket]]).  At the time of writing, only around 7 built-in extensions remain which still expose resources...

===== Discussion =====

This time, the question is not whether the remaining resources should be converted to objects, but the timeline when we can do so, in order to have acceptable level of backward compatibility breaks, since ''is_resource()'' invocations will not return ''true'' anymore for the relevant data structures (read [[https://externals.io/message/116127#116176|a long thread about this topic here]]).

Therefore, the goal of this RFC is to set the rules according to which the project can continue. So far, the vast majority of the individual conversions were "unofficial", meaning they didn't have to go through the formal RFC process, there was no deprecation period (it is not really feasible anyway), and were performed even in minor versions. I do believe this kind of flexibility has been beneficial for the overall project, while the introduced BC breaks are not difficult to fix, we still get complaints from time to time due to these unexpected BC breaks. That's what this RFC should prevent for future conversions.

==== Process resource ====

The ''Process'' resource is returned by ''proc_open()''.

==== Stream-related resources ====

There are a number of stream-related resources which are to be converted.

==== Other resources ====

The rest of the built-in extensions which currently expose resources are the following:

  * ODBC
  * SOAP
  * COM
  * DBA
  * OCI8
