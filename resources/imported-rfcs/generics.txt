Many languages, including hack by now, support generics, which for instance allow to create and typehint for specialized collections without the need to implement such a collection for every single entity.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
