===== Introduction =====

According to [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.list.php|PHP documentation]] list() construct doesn't work with strings.
However in some cases it works.

<code>
$ php -r 'list($a,$b) = "aa";var_dump($a,$b);'
NULL
NULL
$ php -r '$a[0]="ab"; list($a,$b) = $a[0]; var_dump($a,$b);'
string(1) "a"
string(1) "b"
</code>

This behavior caused by implementation feature and wasn't made on purpose.

===== Proposal =====

Make list() behave with strings in consistent way. There are two options:

==== Disable string handling in all cases ====

This will disable undocumented feature and it may break some existing PHP code.

==== Enable string handling in all cases ====

This will make the following code work.

<code>
list($a,$b) = "str";
</code>

Instead of assignment NULL into $a and $b, it'll assign 's' and 't' characters.
However, it also may break some existing PHP code.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Both options may affect existing PHP code.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP7

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
  * disable string handling in all cases
  * enable string handling in all cases

This project requires a 2/3 majority

===== Patches and Tests =====
The implementation is not really a problem.
