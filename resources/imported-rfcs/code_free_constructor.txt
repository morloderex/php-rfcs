===== Introduction =====
Mainly "code free" constructors used for declaration of DTO-classes.
Also, some developers believe that it is good OOP-practice.
Unfortunately they looks like unnecessary boilerplate.

===== Proposal =====
Proposal is to add alternate syntax for "code free" constructors.
Current syntax:
<code php>
class Test{
    public function __construct($first, $second){
        $this->first  = $first;
        $this->second = $second;
    }
    ...
}
</code>

Proposed syntax:
<code php>
class Test($first, $second){
    ...
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
Not thinking so

===== Future Scope =====
Deal with parent's constructor call

===== Implementation =====
Draft implementation, need to be reviewed.
