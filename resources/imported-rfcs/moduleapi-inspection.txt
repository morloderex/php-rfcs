===== Introduction =====

Was asked at PHPBenelux about being able to tell what PHP version a given module is loadable in (given only the .so).  Since the answer came down to "Try it and see if it works", I thought something more formal would be nice.

===== Proposal =====

Add zend module api introspection to php-cli as two new command line switches

`--apino` option: Outputs PHP's compiled Zend Module API info:

  $ sapi/cli/php --apino
  ZEND_MODULE_API_NO: 20131227
  ZEND_DEBUG:         enabled
  ZTS:                enabled

`--modinfo /path/to/module.so` Options: Loads the .so (without attempting to register it as an extension) and output the corresponding Zend Module API info the module was compiled with.

  $ sapi/cli/php --modinfo /usr/libexec/php/hello.so
  ZEND_MODULE_API_NO: 20121212
  ZEND_DEBUG:         disabled
  ZTS:                disabled

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Very old zend_module_entry versions have slightly different module headers.  I addressed this by putting a bottom limit on the Zend Module API Version I'll look at which corresponds to 5.0.  In earlier versions only the high-level API version number is shown.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

5.next

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

CLI

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

This doesn't impact the engine or runtime at all.  It's just a set of options for the command line sapi which dump some info and exit.

===== Implementation =====
