===== Introduction =====
Modern UNIX kernels include additional, contextual information when delivering a signal, however the callable handler for [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-signal.php|pcntl_signal]] does not receive this information. Developers coordinating multiple processes through signals must arrange to gather and send this same information using alternative channels, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and unnecessary.


===== Proposal =====
Currently the signal handler receives only one formal argument, the [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html|number of the signal]] sent. This proposal would add a second formal argument, an array of signal info as provided by the underlying system's kernel.

One possible use case is identifying the process ID of the signal //sender//, [[http://serverfault.com/a/94995/204816|described at the C level in this StackOverflow Q&A]] and implemented in PHP as seen here:

<file php>
<?php
pcntl_signal(SIGUSR1, function ($signo, $siginfo) {
    printf('USR1 from %s', $siginfo['pid'] ?? 'unknown');
});
posix_kill(0, SIGUSR1);
</file>

Other uses cases include identifying the cause of the signal (such as asynchronous I/O or timer expiration), identifying the sending user, and finding the consumed user & system time of an exited process.

The ''$siginfo'' array may contain [[https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man5/siginfo_t.5.asp|one or more of the following keys]], depending upon the system support for signal information and the nature of the sent signal:

  * **''signo''**, the signal number being sent (duplicates the first argument to the handler).
  * **''code''**, the signal code, which depends upon the signal sent and provides context-specific reason //why// the signal was sent.
  * **''value''**, the value for the code, if appropriate for the code.
  * **'' errno''**, the error number associated with the signal, if appropriate for the signal //and// non-zero.
  * **''pid''**, the process ID of the signal sender, if appropriate for the signal.
  * **''uid''**, the real user ID of the signal sender, if appropriate for the signal.
  * **''addr''**, the address at which the faulting signal occurred: only faulting signals like ''SIGFPE'' include this.
  * **''status''**, the status code of an exiting process: only exiting signals like ''SIGCHLD'' include this.
  * **''band''**, the asynchronous I/O band, if appropriate for the signal.
  * **''mtime''**, the time of last data modification, if appropriate for the signal.

The naming of ''$siginfo'' and its keys comes from the ''pcntl_sigwaitinfo'' implementation. (So for example, "''signo''" in PHP comes from "''si_signo''" in the C structure, the leading "si_" having been removed by the PHP engine.) Name normalization does not apply to the values of the ''code'' field, as those represent system-specific values that follow no normative naming convention.

Some older systems not conforming to [[https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1003.1-2001.html|POSIX.1-2001]] (where this structure was formally codified) may not support passing the additional context. In such case, PHP will pass ''null'' as the second argument to the handler.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

There are no backward compatibility breaks.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 7.x.


===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

None.


==== To Existing Extensions ====

The ''[[http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcntl.php|pcntl]]'' extension will be updated.


==== To Opcache ====

None.


===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Vote shall be Yes or No to deliver kernel-provided additional context to the ''pcntl_signal'' handler.

Requires a 50%+1 majority.
