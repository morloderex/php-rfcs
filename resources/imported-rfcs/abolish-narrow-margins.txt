====== PHP RFC: Abolish Narrow Margins ======

===== Introduction =====

When the RFC process was enshrined in internal law, we were very aware that setting the bar too high for new features may reduce the number of contributors we had. We decided that it was acceptable for a "non-language feature" to be merged with only a slim majority of 50%+1.

The nomenclature "language feature" is misleading and confusing, for new contributors and old alike - some people think it is synonymous with "syntax", others think it anything that is merged into /Zend, others think it anything that faces the end user. Various definitions have co-existed in the minds of contributors because we have never taken the effort to define exactly what "language feature" includes or excludes.

Anything merged into php-src is by definition a core part of PHP, regardless of the folder it goes into, or whether it has direct implications for our users. This is not a debatable fact: If it is distributed with PHP, it is core software.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes that //all// RFC's need to meet the same high standard, regardless of the proposals therein: Any vote that would result in merges into the source repository must require a super majority of 2/3.

This change means that the main vote in any RFC must have a super majority. Any subsidiary votes (conducted concurrently with, or subsequent to a main vote) may use a simple majority to resolve implementation details. However, if a subsidiary vote passing would result in merges into php-src that would otherwise not take place, it must also achieve a 2/3 majority.

These new rules are unambiguous, and much more suited to a project the size and scope of PHP.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
A straight yes/no vote.

//If this RFC passes the vote, the original [[/rfc/voting|voting RFC]] will be amended to reflect current requirements, and have the version changed.//

===== Discussion Topics ======

  * Suggestion that we should raise standard even higher (75%): rejected on the grounds that the bar is high enough at 2/3, we don't want less contributions, we want clearer outcomes.
  * Suggestion that we should introduce quorum: this is not the topic of this RFC.
  * Suggestion that we should change who can vote: this is not the topic of this RFC.
  * Suggestion that we should always require a reason to accompany a negative vote: this is not the topic of this RFC.
