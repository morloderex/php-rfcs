===== Introduction =====

The current political climate of Earth shows us that votes that are won by narrow margins build resentment among voters, can lead to instability in the ecosphere, and could be considered harmful to democracy.

===== Proposal =====
All of the reasons that we require a super majority for language features apply to everything that we are doing.

This RFC proposes that //all// RFC's need to meet the same high standard, whether they directly affect the language or not. That adding a new function, or feature is not so different from changing an old one that we should lower the standard for acceptance. Even when we are changing processes, it is important to have the support of a clear majority.

50%+1 is just not a high enough standard for us any more; all RFC's (this one included) should require a super majority (2/3+1).

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
A straight yes/no vote.
