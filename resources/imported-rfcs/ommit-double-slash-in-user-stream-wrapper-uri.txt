====== PHP RFC: Ommit double-slash in user Stream Wrapper URI ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2017-01-23
  * Author: Micha≈Ç Brzuchalski <michal.brzuchalski@gmail.com>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/ommit-double-slash-in-user-stream-wrapper-uri

===== Introduction =====
According to RFC 2396 defining [[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt|URI Generic Syntax]] which specifies URI Syntactic Components:

> The URI syntax is dependent upon the scheme.

> The URI syntax does not require that the scheme-specific-part have
> any general structure or set of semantics which is common among all
> URI.

However it is not currently possible to declare user-defined Stream Wrapper and register valid protocol which could handle generic URI's. Currently there is requirement of ''%%://%%'' after protocol name when protocol name from URL detection is called.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to add new flag ''STREAM_IS_URI'' to use with [[http://pl1.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-register.php|stream_wrapper_register]] in a third parameter.

Passing new flag allows user defined Stream Wrapper class based on [[http://pl1.php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php|streamWrapper prototype]] to handle URI in their general syntax consisting of ''<scheme>'' and ''<scheme-specific-part>'' whose interpretation depends on the scheme.

===== Examples =====

<code php>
class MyStreamWrapper {
  public function url_stat(string $path, int $flags) : array {
    print "Stating file: $path\n";
    return array('dev'=>1, 'ino'=>2, 'mode'=>0644, 'nlink'=>3,
        'uid'=>100, 'gid'=>1000, 'rdev'=>-1, 'size'=>31337,
        'atime'=>1234567890, 'mtime'=>1231231231, 'ctime'=>1234564564,
        'blksize'=>-1, 'blocks'=>-1);
  }
}

stream_wrapper_register('test', MyStreamWrapper::class, STREAM_IS_URI);
file_exists('test:file.txt');
</code>

Output:
<code>
Stating file: test:file.txt
</code>


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No backward incompatible changes, when the additional flag is missing all handled paths are checked in case of double slash existence after the colon.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
next PHP 7.x

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No impact.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

No.

==== To Opcache ====

No.

==== New Constants ====

''STREAM_IS_URI = 2'' - allows user Stream Wrapper to handle all variety of URI's without double-slash after colon

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

This project requires a 2/3 majority. The vote is a straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC and merging the patch.
