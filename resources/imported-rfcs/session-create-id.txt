====== PHP RFC: Add session_create_id() function ======

===== Introduction =====
Session ID is created by session internal bin_to_reabable() function. bin_to_readable() creates readable string from binary data depending. New session_create_id() uses bin_to_readable() to create user defined session ID string. Session ID may use 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', ',', '-'. Without session_create_id(), user has to implement their own bin_to_readable() in user land.

===== Proposal =====

Add session_create_id() function

  string session_create_id([string $prefix])

session_create_id() will create new session ID by

  * Default internal function(php_session_create_id()) when session is not active.
  * User defined session ID creation function when session is active.

Session ID collision is detected upon session_start(). Therefore, different session ID could be assigned by collision and session.use_strict_mode=1.  User defined session ID creation function may detect collisions if collision is a problem.

Note: Session ID creation function is not documented, but it's there.
http://php.net/manual/en/book.session.php
It's not documented because Object based save handler has non standard method name. i.e. create_sid() rather than createSid(). Rename will be proposed by different RFC. If you would like to see how it is used, please refer to phpt files.

  * and so on


==== Use case ====

Prefix session by userid hash.

<code php>
<?php
function create_logged_in_session($uid) {
  // Mark obsolete session as obsolete.
  $_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] = time(); // Warn access to this session after a few minutes. Should be checked upon starting session.

  // Prepare new logged in SID
  $sid = session_create_id($uid.'-');  // Session is active here. So user defined session ID creation function is used. It may check collision optionally.
  session_commit();
  ini_set('session.use_strict_mode', false);
  session_id($sid);
  session_start(); // If save handler has validate_sid() callback, collision is detected when use_strict_mode=1.
}

function my_session_start() {
  session_start();
  // Check obsolete session
  if ($_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] < time() - 300) {
    throw new Exception('Obsolete session access. Possible security breach');
  }
}
?>
</php>

If session is stored by database, administrators are able to list active session per uid easily and efficiently.
