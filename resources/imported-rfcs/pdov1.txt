====== Request for Comments: PDO version 1 improvements ======
  * Version: pre alpha 0.1
  * Date: 2008-03-06
  * Author: Lukas Smith <smith@pooteeweet.org>
  * Status: Under Discussion

This RFC aims to collect a set of ideas to improve PDO version 1. These ideas will hopefully end up in a set of concret feature requests and patches.

===== Introduction =====

PDO is a thin layer above native RDBMS interfaces. As such its focused on providing a unified API on the PHP level without getting too much into SQL abstraction. PDO provides a framework to make the development of RDBMS specific drivers for PDO easier.

==== Why do we need improvements to PDO? ====

PDO has become the de-facto standard for the development of PHP libraries that interact with RDBMS. As such developers have come to expect that PDO minimizes any portability differences to a minimum, while accepting that PDO will not solve most issues in the differences of the actual SQL syntax.

===== Common Misconceptions =====

A lot in PDO can be fixed without a new major version.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

  * Fix differences in behavior for data fetches (possibly add a compatibility mode in order to maintain BC)
  * Add a common syntax to specify the DSN along the lines of the PEAR DSN format
  * Add some better debugging hooks (like a way to get the last submitted statement, this is important especially when PDO does some rewriting like with prepared statements)
  * Fix differences in when bind/prepare issues an exception for an invalid bound value/parameter.
  * Add ability to bind short binary values
  * Add ability to generate a properly quoted comma separated list to be embedded in a query inside an IN() clause (see [[http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2/docs/latest/MDB2/MDB2_Driver_Datatype_Common.html#methodimplodeArray|implodeArray()]])
  * Better documentation and testing
  * Add support for CLOB fields in Oracle (and other databases) and generally work harder on making the LOB behavior more similar across the drivers (see [[http://pecl.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=7943|Bug 7943]])
  * Add ability to manage connection session aspects like charset/collation, locale (datetime/currency format)
  * Add limited sub select emulation (see [[http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2/docs/latest/MDB2/MDB2_Driver_Common.html#methodsubSelect|subSelect()]])
  * Improve the prepared statement emulation parser to better deal with quoted strings that contain things that look like a placeholder
  * Add support of multiple resultsets for mssql and odbc on all platforms.
  * Fix the problems with ODBC prepared statements when executing procedures on all platforms.
  * Add support for datatypes like float and datetime/timestamp
