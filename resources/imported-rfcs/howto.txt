====== Request for Comments: How to write RFCs ======

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of RFCs are to work collaboratively towards a specification and finally an implementation of an idea. RFCs provide a means for features to be evaluated, and then rejected or approved by voting.

At the time of writing, there wasn't any real information about the procedure regarding writing an RFC. This RFC is an attempt to document that, consolidating what little information is available, and to set forth a standard procedure. It's a meta-RFC of sorts, not documenting any changes to PHP itself.

===== What RFC should cover/Questions to answer =====
  * How to obtain wiki permissions
    * Is there a standard procedure for this?
  * How to write
    * Standards of completeness, etc.
    * Is the current template enough of a starting point?
    * Good examples?
  * Voting process
    * Who is allowed to vote?
    * What are the mechanics of this?
  * What else?
  * Should this be a wiki page?
===== Proposal (incomplete) =====

Creating an RFC is a multi-stage process:

==== Wiki Privileges ====

To write an RFC, a wiki account and karma need to be obtained. First, register for an account at [[https://wiki.php.net/start?do=register]]. Read the instructions: you must email the webmaster to get an account.

==== Sections ====

RFCs should have the following sections, at minimum (if appropriate, some may be omitted):

  * Top-level meta section, named "Request for Comments: <RFC name>", (e.g. "Request for Comments: array_part"). Under this should be the Version, Date, Author, Status, and "First Published At", showing the URL it was initially published at. It should also have a very brief summary of the RFC's purpose
  * Introduction, which should provide some background information and a summary of what is being proposed
  * Specification, specifying what is being implemented (function, syntax, etc.)
  * Proposed Implementation, if any
  * Tests, if any
  * Objections
  * Vote
  * Changelog
