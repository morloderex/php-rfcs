===== How To Create an RFC =====

Newcomers to PHP core development should read [[https://blogs.oracle.com/opal/entry/the_mysterious_php_rfc_process|The Mysterious PHP RFC Process and How You Can Change the Web]] before starting the RFC process.

  - Email internals@lists.php.net to measure reaction to your intended proposal. Only proceed with an RFC if feedback is not negative or if a detailed RFC will clarify the proposal. Mail list subscription is at http://php.net/mailing-lists.php.  //Note//: If you don't have the skills to fully implement the RFC and no-one volunteers to code it, there is little chance your RFC will be successful.
  - Get wiki RFC karma (this is only required if you don't have a VCS account for php.net. PHP developers can log on with their credentials and already have the necessary karma to create RFCs):
      - Register for a wiki account at https://wiki.php.net/start?do=register.
      - Email php-webmaster@lists.php.net requesting RFC karma for your wiki account. In the email, remind people about the RFC you plan to create.
  - Create the RFC:
      - Log into the wiki with your wiki account.
      - Navigate to a URL like https://wiki.php.net/RFC/my_RFC (use your feature name in the URL). 
      - Push the "Create this page" button, fill out the template and save
      - Edit https://wiki.php.net/RFC and link your RFC under the "In Draft" status.
      - Write the RFC.
  - When your RFC is ready for discussion:
    - Change the status of your RFC page to "Under Discussion"
    - Change its section on https://wiki.php.net/RFC to "Under Discussion"
    - Send email to internals@lists.php.net introducing your RFC.
  - Listen to the feedback, and try to answer/resolve all questions.  Update your RFC to document //all// the issues and discussions.  Cover both the positive and negative arguments.
  - When discussion ends, and a minimum period of two weeks has passed since you mailed internals@lists.php.net in step 4, then you can move your RFC to "Voting" status.  Review https://wiki.php.net/RFC/voting#voting first. Consider whether the feature concept should be voted on before you invest time in implementation. Or perhaps an implementation is needed to show the feature is feasible; in this case make it clear whether or not the current implementation is being voted on.
    - Update your RFC page to "Voting" status
    - Add the doodle voting macro, for example: <code>
    <doodle 
      title="RFC/voting" auth="user" voteType="multi" closed="false">
      * Yes?
      * No?
    </doodle></code>
    - Move your RFC on https://wiki.php.net/RFC to "Voting".
    - Send email to internals@lists.php.net announcing the start of voting for your RFC. Start a new mail thread and put "[VOTE]" in the subject. Set a deadline for voting; the minimum period is one week.
  - Based on the result of the votes and the discussion there are three possible outcomes:
    - Your RFC is accepted: update the status of your RFC page and its section on https://wiki.php.net/RFC and close the voting via changing closed="false" to closed="true" in the voting macro.
    - Your RFC is declined: update the status of your RFC page and its section on https://wiki.php.net/RFC and close the voting via changing closed="false" to closed="true" in the voting macro.
    - A serious issue with your RFC needs to be addressed: your RFC goes back to Under Discussion. Update the status of your RFC page and its section on https://wiki.php.net/RFC and continue from step 5.
