  - register a wiki account at https://wiki.php.net/start?do=register
  - send an email to php-webmaster@lists.php.net for requesting rfc karma for your wiki account
  - log in with your wiki account and navigate to https://wiki.php.net/rfc/my_rfc and push the Create this page button, fill out the template and save
  - edit https://wiki.php.net/rfc to link your rfc under the appropriate status
  - when you think your rfc is ready for discussion, send an email to the internals@lists.php.net mailing list introducing your RFC
  - listen to the feedback, and try to answer/resolve then and update your RFC to reflect those issues
  - if the discussion ended (or if you really want to bring it to voting and the minimal amount of discussion period stated on https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting#discussion_period was reached) then you can move your RFC to voting:
    - update your rfc page to voting status and add the doodle voting macro for example: 
    <code>
    <doodle 
      title="rfc/voting" auth="user" voteType="multi" closed="true">
      * Yes?
      * No?
    </doodle>
    </code>
    - move your rfc on the https://wiki.php.net/rfc to voting
    - send am email to the internals@lists.php.net with a [VOTE] in the subject where your announce the start of the voting for your RFC (see https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting#voting for more details)
  - Based on the result of the votes and the discussion there are three possible outcomes:
    - Your rfc is accepted, update that on your rfc page and on the https://wiki.php.net/rfc page.
    - Your rfc is declined , update that on your rfc page and on the https://wiki.php.net/rfc page
    - Some serious issue came up with your rfc which needs to be addressed first, your rfc goes back to Under discussion, update that on your rfc page and on the https://wiki.php.net/rfc page and continue from point 6.

Step 1 and 2 only required if you don't have a vcs account for php.net, as the php developers can already log on with their account and have the necessary wiki karma to create RFCs. ======
