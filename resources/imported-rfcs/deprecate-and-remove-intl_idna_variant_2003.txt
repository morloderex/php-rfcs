====== PHP RFC: Deprecate and remove INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 ======
  * Version: 1.1
  * Date: 2017-01-07
  * Author: Christoph M. Becker, cmb@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

As of ICU 55.1 (released 2015-04-01) the [[http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/tags/release-55-1/APIChangeReport.html#deprecated|IDNA2003 APIs are deprecated]], because [[https://sourceforge.net/p/icu/mailman/message/32980778/|UTS #46 should be preferred over the obsolete IDNA 2003 variant]]. However, the intl extension still uses INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 as default for [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.idn-to-ascii.php|idn_to_ascii()]] and [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.idn-to-utf8.php|idn_to_utf8()]], which should be changed as soon as possible.

===== Proposal =====

Therefore I suggest the following procedure:

  * //PHP 7.2//: deprecate INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003
  * //PHP 7.4//: change the default of idn_to_ascii()'s and idn_to_utf8()'s $variant parameter to INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_UTS46
  * //PHP 8.0//: remove support for INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 altogether

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Obviously, code explicitly using INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 would break (during PHP 7 only with regard to triggering a deprecation notice), and code relying on the default variant might break (however, it might be "magically" fixed as well).

===== RFC Impact =====

Besides the obvious behavioral changes to idn_to_ascii() an idn_to_utf8() there is no further impact on SAPIs, extensions or OPcache.

===== Open Issues =====

None, yet.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Whether to implement the proposal above, or not.

This RFC requires a 2/3 majority.

===== Patches and Tests =====
