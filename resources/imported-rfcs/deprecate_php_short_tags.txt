====== PHP RFC: Deprecate PHP Short tags ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-03-20
  * Author: George Peter Banyard, girgias@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_php_short_tags

===== Introduction =====

PHP has provided over the years different ways to signal to the parser when to begin other than the usual <php><?php ... ?></php>. Most of these tags have been removed with PHP 7.0.0, however PHP short tags remain.

===== Proposal =====
Deprecate and remove PHP short tags.

===== Reasoning =====

  * The PHP documentation discourage their usage. [[manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php]]
  * PHP short tags clash with XML <code><?xml ?></code> and can mean two different things depending on the INI configuration.
  * PHP short tags depend on an INI directive and as such are non-portable.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Every script which currently uses <php><?</php> will need to convert to <php><?php</php>.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Deprecation notice in PHP 7.4 and removal in PHP 8.0

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None to my understanding.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Extensions using <php><?</php> will need to convert to <php><?php</php>.

==== To Opcache ====
None to my understanding.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
Change <php>short_open_tag</php> from ''"1"'' to ''"0"''

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
The <php><?=</php> short tag is unaffected as of PHP 5.4 it is always available.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As with all new RFCs this proposal requires a 2/3 majority

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
