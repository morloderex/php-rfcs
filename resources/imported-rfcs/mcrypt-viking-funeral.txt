===== Introduction =====

Let's get rid of ext/mcrypt, which is abandonware and inhibits the growth of the language, as soon as humanly possible.

===== Proposal =====

In PHP 7.1, all mcrypt_* functions will raise an E_DEPRECATED notice.

In PHP 7.1+1 (be it 7.2 or 8.0), the mcrypt extension will be moved out of core and into PECL, where people who *really* want to install it may still do so if they can install PHP extensions from PECL.

This RFC does not concern itself with the concept of shims or compatibility layers, and those topics are out of scope. If this RFC passes, another RFC could be drafted by interested parties to propose such a feature at a later date.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Any cryptography code that depends on mcrypt will need to be refactored against openssl. This isn't as difficult as it sounds, provided you're using a trustworthy cipher (e.g. MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128).

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Deprecation: Next minor version (7.1.0).

Removal from core: The following major/minor version (7.2.0 or 8.0.0).


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Vote "Yes" to raise an E_DEPRECATED notice in PHP 7.1 when any mcrypt function is used and to remove the extension from core in 7.1+1.

Since this would break backwards compatiblity, a 2/3 is appropriate.

===== Patches and Tests =====

If this RFC is accepted, I will author the patch to expunge ext/mcrypt.
