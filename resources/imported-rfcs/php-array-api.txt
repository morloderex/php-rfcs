===== Introduction =====

Adding values to PHP Array style HashTables is already very easy:

  add_assoc_long(arr, "life", 42);
  add_index_string(arr, 7, "A lucky number");
  add_next_index_double(arr, 3.1415926535);

This header file provides similar convenience wrappers to the zend_hash_(index_)_(find|exists|del) functions to ease extension writing.

===== Self-documented implementation =====

https://github.com/sgolemon/php-array-api/blob/master/php_array.h

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None, it's a header.  My intention at this point is to put this in main/php_array.h and include it in the installed headers target.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

5.6, though non-bundled extensions could easily drop this file into their packages and use it on any PHP version >= 4.0

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Could include this in Zend/ instead of main/...
