====== PHP RFC: Zend VM Pause API ======
  * Version: 0.9

This RPC has been obsolete. Please see https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2902 for more detail.

===== Introduction =====
There is no API for change the Zend VM's execute flow. The only approach to change the Zend VM's execute flow is
introducing a new keyword and making a new opline, and use ZEND_VM_RETURN/ZEND_VM_CONTINUE macro in its handler.

So it is impossible to change the Zend VM's execute flow in an zend extension. As a result, any feature, like Fiber,
related to Zend VM's execute flow cannot be implemented by a standalone extension.

===== Proposal =====
This PRFC propose a new vm_interrupt type, by which some zend extension could make the zend vm execution pause and return.
So we can implement feature like Fiber in a standalone extension.
