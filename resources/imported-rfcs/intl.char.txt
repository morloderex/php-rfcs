====== PHP RFC: IntlChar class ======

===== Introduction =====

ICU exposes a great deal of i18n/l10n functionality beyond what is currently exposed by PHP.  This RFC seeks to expose just a little bit more...

===== Proposal =====

Expose additional ICU functionality from [[http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/uchar_8h.html|uchar.h]] as  IntlChar::*() following the ICU API as much as possible.

See hphp/runtime/ext/icu/ext_icu_uchar.php in [[https://reviews.facebook.net/D30573]] for a full breakdown of the functions (complete with docblocks).   Constants can be found in either PR's *-enum.h files.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7 (or 5.next if there is one)

==== New Constants ====

Enumerations of UProperty, UCharNameChoice, UPropertyNameChoice, UCharDirection, UBlockCode, etc...  For example:

  class IntlChar {
    const PROPERTY_ALPHABETIC = _UCHAR_ALPHABETIC_;
    const PROPERTY_ASCII_HEX_DIGIT = _UCHAR_ASCII_HEX_DIGIT_;
    /* etc... */
  }

==== New Static Methods ====

Mapping of ICU API to PHP.  For example:

  class IntlChar {
    static public function hasBinaryProperty(int $codepoint, int $property): bool;
    static public function isAlphabetic(int $codepoint): bool;
    /* etc... */
  }

Note that properties taking a codepoint will accept either an integer codepoint value (e.g. 0x2603 for U+2603 SNOWMAN), or the character encoded as UTF-8 (e.g. "\xE2\x98\x83").  For methods which return a codepoint, they will return int unless they accepted a codepoint as a utf-8 string, in which case they remain utf-8.

===== Notes =====

I also added IntlChar::chr() and IntlChar::ord() which aren't directly part of the API, but they made sense as wrappers for the U8_*() family of macros.

Some methods take a range in the form ($start, $limit) which the range is INclusive of $start, and EXclusive of $limit.  i.e. (0x20, 0x30) => 0x20..0x2F.  I kept this meaning for $limit to stay consistent with the ICU API, but changing $limit to have the semantics of $end would probably make more sense in PHP.
