===== Introduction =====
PHP currently contains two data types which are copy-on-write (CoW): string and arrays. When you pass a variable containing a CoW type as an argument to a function, you don't copy the data. Instead, you increment the reference count of the data by one. The lowest possible reference count for a variable passed to a function is therefore 2: one reference is the variable, and the other is the function argument. Let's look at a toy code example:

<code php>
function my_function(array $my_array) {
    // Remember: $my_array has a reference count of 2:
    //   one reference in $array (main), and one in $my_array (my_function).
    $my_array[] = 3;
    return $my_array;
}

function main() {
    $array = [0, 1, 2];
    $array = my_function($array);
    var_dump($array);
}

main();
</code>

The code example shows an array being passed to "my_function", which modifies the array and returns the modified result. However, due to the copy-on-write (CoW) mechanism, the variable "$my_array" is copied within "my_function" because the array's reference count is greater than 1 and it is modified. In this example, the copy is unnecessary because the result always overwrites the original array. The purpose of this RFC is to propose an optimisation for avoiding such unnecessary copies.

While this example may not highlight the significance of the copy cost, there are scenarios where it does matter, such as processing large data batches (e.g., Extract-Transform-Load processes) or having more complex data manipulation functions. The reason for having a separate "main()" function in the example will become clear later in the proposal.

A similar case where this optimisation is beneficial is for variables which are passed to functions and then never used again the caller.

===== Proposal =====

We will first give some brief background information and then dive into the technical details of the proposal.

=== Background ===

During optimisation, opcache will transform the PHP opcodes into Static Single Assignment (SSA) form. This is a special representation in which every variable has a single definition. An SSA variable is thus not the same as a PHP variable. In fact, a PHP variable may correspond to many SSA variables because of the single definition requirement. Let's take a look at the following PHP code and how it looks in SSA form.

<code php>
function main(array $array) {
    $a = $array;
    $a = array_merge($a, [4]);
}
</code>

This results in the following SSA code, with the type information removed for clarity.

<code>
main:
     ; #0.CV0($array) NOVAL
     ; #1.CV1($a) NOVAL
0000 #2.CV0($array) = RECV 1
0001 #3.CV1($a) = QM_ASSIGN #2.CV0($array)
0002 INIT_FCALL 2 112 string("array_merge")
0003 SEND_VAR #3.CV1($a) 1
0004 SEND_VAL array(...) 2
0005 #5.V3 = DO_ICALL
0006 ASSIGN #3.CV1($a) -> #6.CV1($a) NOVAL #5.V3
0007 RETURN null
</code>

Let's break it down.
A variable that's actually in the code, like "$array" and "$a" is called a Compiled Variable (CV). CV0 refers to "$array" and CV1 refers to "$a". As an SSA variable may only be assigned once, but there are multiple assignments to "$a", "$a" is numbered in the SSA code. We have: "#0.CV0($array)" and "#2.CV0($array)" for "$array"; and "#1.CV1($a)", "#3.CV1($a)", and "#6.CV1($a)" for "$a".
Every time "$a" is modified, the SSA variable needs to be "redefined". The counter after the pound symbol will increase and from that point on the SSA variable we use for "$a" is the one with the incremented counter. In particular, the PHP code "$a = array_merge($a, [4]);" results in using the SSA variable "#3.CV1($a)" and the assignment results in a new SSA variable "#6.CV1($a)".

=== Technical Details ===

This optimisation, known as "implicit move," will be added to the existing optimisation pipeline as an SSA-based optimization. The term "implicit" indicates that this optimisation occurs automatically: it eliminates the need for PHP developers to take any specific action. The “move” refers to the fact that the lifetime and data is moved into the called function. The optimisation is only applied to local variables, because properties and array dimensions are not represented as SSA variables.

The implementation pull request introduces this optimisation by setting a special flag on the opcodes for SEND_VAR and SEND_VAR_EX, indicating the possibility of an implicit move. A specialized VM handler is implemented to handle cases where this flag is set. It passes the array/string as an argument without creating a copy and it unsets the original variable. As a result, the reference count of the array/string remains unchanged. If the data's reference count is 1, it remains as such when the callee executes. Therefore, the need for a copy (even when the data is modified) is avoided.

When do we set that flag? The SSA optimisation pipeline already detects when an SSA variable is never used after its definition. This happens using the NOVAL flag. We use this information, along with alias information, to determine when to set the flag. Furthermore, the flag can only be set if the variable may be an array or may be a string.

Because the optimisation unsets the PHP variable, we need a new SSA definition for the affected PHP variable. The SSA code from above will look like this with this optimisation:

<code>
main:
     ; #0.CV0($array) NOVAL
     ; #1.CV1($a) NOVAL
0000 #2.CV0($array) = RECV 1
0001 #3.CV1($a) = QM_ASSIGN #2.CV0($array)
0002 INIT_FCALL 2 112 string("array_merge")
0003 SEND_VAR #3.CV1($a) -> #4.CV1($a) NOVAL 1
0004 SEND_VAL array(...) 2
0005 #5.V3 = DO_ICALL
0006 ASSIGN #4.CV1($a) NOVAL -> #6.CV1($a) NOVAL #5.V3
0007 RETURN null
</code>

As we can see above, there is now a redefinition for "$a" ("#4.CV1($a)") in the SEND_VAR opcode. The optimisation pass sees that "#4.CV1($a)" has the NOVAL flag, which indicates its result is never used again. It also knows that "$a" may be an array, and "$a" is not an argument of "main". Therefore, the special flag is set on the SEND_VAR opcode.

==== Constraints ====

There are situations where this optimisation cannot be applied. Specifically, we cannot allow the user code to observe the unsetting of the variable.

The optimisation is not applied if the caller uses one of the following:
  * Variadic arguments
  * "func_get_args" etc.
  * Variable variables
  * "compact", "extract" etc.
  * Try - catch/finally

Furthermore, the optimisation is also not applied on the pseudo-main function of PHP, because of globals. In fact, no SSA-based optimisations take place in that case because of global complications.
It is also not applied on arguments in the **caller**. This is because it could influence backtraces from exceptions or influence the result of "debug_get_backtrace". For example:

<code php>
function boom(array $x) {
    throw new Exception("boom");
}

function test(array $x) {
    boom($x);
}

function main() {
    test(range(1, 10));
}

main();
</code>

If we were to allow the optimisation on **caller** arguments, this would give the following output:
<code>
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Exception: boom in test.php:4
Stack trace:
#0 test.php(8): boom(Array)
#1 test.php(12): test(NULL)
#2 test.php(15): main()
#3 {main}
  thrown in test.php on line 4
</code>

Notice that the argument for "test" is NULL according to the backtrace. This is because the data and the lifetime has been moved into "boom". Because of this observation artifact, we don't perform the optimisation in the above case.

==== Examples ====

Not only userland functions can benefit from this optimisation, builtin functions can too.
Some builtin functions already avoid a copy if the array argument has a reference count of 1. One example of a builtin function that already does this is "array_merge". Combined with the proposed optimisation, the following code will become a lot faster:

<code php>
function array_merge_loop($n) {
    $a = range(1, 3);
    for ($i = 0; $i < $n; ++$i) {
        $a = array_merge($a, [1, 2, 3]);
    }
}
</code>

For 30000 iterations **without** the optimisation, this takes 3.405s on my machine. **With** the optimisation this takes only 0.002s. This is an artificial micro-benchmark for a single function of course, but it shows that the idea works.

Other examples of builtin functions that are optimised for a reference count of 1 are "array_replace", "array_unique", and "array_intersect". More functions can follow in the future.

==== Alternatives ====

There are two alternative solutions to the problem outlined in this proposal: references, or explicit moves. I will discuss each of them briefly and explain why they are not ergonomic solutions.

=== References ===

You might wonder why we cannot just use references instead to prevent copies. References are less ergonomic for developers because they are rarely used, and it can be surprising to developers that functions use references as an optimisation. Surprising behaviour can lead to bugs. Furthermore, builtin functions such as "array_merge", "array_replace", etc., don't take a reference so those functions wouldn't be able to avoid a copy.

For ergonomics, take a look at the following code example:

<code php>
function my_function(array &$my_array) {
    $my_array[] = 3;
    var_dump($my_array); // Do something interesting
}

function example_ref() {
    $array = [0, 1, 2];
    my_function($array); // No copy, we want to change the array
}

function example_copy() {
    $array = [0, 1, 2];
    $array_copy = array_merge($array, []); // copy the array
    my_function($array_copy); // Operates on the copy
    var_dump($array); // Should be the original
}
</code>

In the function "example_ref", we want to modify "$array" in-place, while in "example_copy" we want the original array to stay the same. With references We have to explicitly copy the array if we want to keep the original. If we instead have an optimisation that can detect when it can modify in-place, then we can avoid references and the code becomes simpler (while still avoiding a copy):

<code php>
function my_function(array $my_array) {
    $my_array[] = 3;
    var_dump($my_array); // Do something interesting
}

function example_ref() {
    $array = [0, 1, 2];
    my_function($array); // No copy, we want to change the array
}

function example_copy() {
    $array = [0, 1, 2];
    my_function($array); // Operates on the copy
    var_dump($array); // Should be the original
}
</code>

=== Explicit Moves ===

An alternative is creating a new keyword "move", which the programmer can place manually in their code to perform the move optimisation manually. Ilija has prototyped this in the past, independently from this proposal.
An optimisation that is applied automatically is more ergonomic and automatically benefits existing PHP code.

==== Risks ====

Every optimisation that gets added to PHP has the risk of introducing breakages. In particular, the type inference needs to be changed to reflect the move of a variable. Type inference is heavily used in the JIT engine, so there's a concern that this optimisation might cause bugs in the JIT. The type inference only affects SSA variables that are not used again, so it should not have an impact on the JIT.

The SSA construction change does introduce a **compile-time** performance decrease for WordPress because the optimiser performs extra work. However, the optimisation improves the **run-time** performance of WordPress slightly, which is what actually matters.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

There's a subtle BC break. Consider the following code:

<code php>
class Foo {
    public function __destruct() {
        var_dump(1);
    }
}

function test(array $x) {
    unset($x[0]);
}

function main() {
    $x = [new Foo];
    test($x);
    var_dump(2);
}

main();
</code>

Without this optimisation this will first output 2, and then 1. But **with** the optimisation this will output 1 first, and then 2. This is because with the optimisation the array "$x" is destroyed after the call to "test" finishes as its lifetime was transferred to "test".
It is hard to predict what the impact will be on real-world applications. Executing code with side-effects which needs to happen in a specific order is dangerous as-is, because even in current PHP no such guarantees are made if objects have cycles for example.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x (which is PHP 8.3 at the time of writing).

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None.

==== To Opcache ====
This proposal implements an extra optimisation in the DFA pass in the optimiser. There need to be changes to SCCP, DFG, type inference, and SSA construction to account for the behaviour change in SEND_VAR. The SEND_VAR opcode now redefines op1 because it can set its type to UNDEF. The type inference needs to reflect that as well.

==== New Constants ====
None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
None.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Everything that's not the optimiser.

===== Future Scope =====
This proposal depends on functions being able to operate on data in-place. Support for this has already been added in 8.3 for the "array_merge", "array_replace", "array_unique", and "array_intersect". More functions (and especially string functions) may follow.
