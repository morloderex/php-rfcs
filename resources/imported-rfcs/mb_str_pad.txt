====== PHP RFC: mb_str_pad ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2023-05-19
  * Author: Niels Dossche (nielsdos), dossche.niels@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/mb_str_pad

===== Introduction =====
Many string functions in PHP come in two different variants: one for byte strings, and one for multibyte strings. This RFC proposes the addition of mb_str_pad to PHP as a multibyte equivalent of the existing str_pad function. The current str_pad function lacks multibyte character support, causing issues when working with languages that utilize multibyte encodings like UTF-8.

===== Proposal =====
All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.

If applicable, you may wish to use the language specification as a reference.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Since this is a new function, and no existing functions change, the risk of a BC break is minimal. The only break occurs when a userland PHP project defines their own mb_str_pad() function without first checking if PHP itself does not define one.
TODO

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 8.x (at the time of writing this is PHP 8.3).

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

None.

==== New Constants ====
None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
None.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Everything outside of mbstring.

===== Future Scope =====
None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
One primary yes/no vote to decide if the function may be introduced.

===== Patches and Tests =====
