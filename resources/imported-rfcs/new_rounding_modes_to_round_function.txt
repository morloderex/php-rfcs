====== PHP RFC: Add 4 new rounding modes to round() function ======
  * Date: 2023-08-31
  * Target version: PHP 8.4
  * Author: Jorg Sowa <jorg.sowa@gmail.com>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12056
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/new_rounding_modes_to_round_function

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to add 4 new modes to the round() function.

  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_up|PHP_ROUND_CEILING]],
  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_down|PHP_ROUND_FLOOR]],
  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_away_from_zero|PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO]],
  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_toward_zero|PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO]].

Two first comments on the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.round.php|documentation page of the round()]] function are related to the missing modes of rounding. The first comment has an outstanding number of 309 votes.

Moreover, the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.numberformatter.php|NumberFormatter]] already implements 4 new proposed modes known as ROUND_CEILING, ROUND_FLOOR, ROUND_DOWN, ROUND_UP.

===== Proposal =====

Adding 4 new constants for the rounding modes of function round():

  * PHP_ROUND_CEILING - rounds num to the nearest integer bigger than num,
  * PHP_ROUND_FLOOR - rounds num to the nearest integer lower than num,
  * PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO - rounds num away from zero,
  * PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO - rounds num towards zero.

Creating two aliases of constants from Intl extension to have consistent naming for rounding modes:

  * ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO (equivalent of PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO) alias of [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.numberformatter.php#numberformatter.constants.round-up|ROUND_UP]]
  * ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO (equivalent of PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO) alias of [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.numberformatter.php#numberformatter.constants.round-down|ROUND_DOWN]]

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None

===== Proposed PHP Versions =====

8.4

===== Questions =====

==== Why not use functions ceil() and floor()? ====
The functions ceil() and floor() round numbers to the full integer, while the function round() rounds the number by given precision. Implementing new rounding modes we get equivalent of those functions using round() with 0 as precision.
<PHP>
ceil($number) === round($number, 0, PHP_ROUND_CEILING); //true
floor($number) === round($number, 0, PHP_ROUND_FLOOR); //true
</PHP>

==== Why not the names PHP_ROUND_UP and PHP_ROUND_DOWN? ====
Such constants already exist in the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.numberformatter.php|NumberFormatter]] and represent rounding modes 'away from zero' and 'toward zero'. However the names rounding up and down are ambiguous. They may be easily confused with the rounding ceiling/floor, while the terms away from/toward zero are distinct.

Those constants would be deprecated and replaced with their corresponding aliases: ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO and ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As per the voting RFC a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started on 2023-09-x and will end on 2023-09-x.

Voting on implementing 4 new rounding modes to `round()` function.

Voting on creating aliases for Intl extension constants ROUND_UP and ROUND_DOWN: ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO and ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO.
