====== PHP RFC: Add 4 new rounding modes to round() function ======
  * Date: 2023-08-31
  * Target version: PHP 8.4
  * Author: Jorg Sowa <jorg.sowa@gmail.com>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12056
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/new_rounding_modes_to_round_function

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to add 4 new modes to the round() function.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment|PHP_ROUND_CEILING]],
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_down|PHP_ROUND_FLOOR]],
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_away_from_zero|PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO]],
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_down|PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO]].

Two first comments on the documentation page of the round() function are related to the missing modes of rounding. The first comment has a outstanding 309 votes.

Moreover, the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.numberformatter.php|NumberFormatter]] already implements 4 new proposed modes known as ROUND_CEILING, ROUND_FLOOR, ROUND_DOWN, ROUND_UP.

===== Proposal =====

Adding 4 new constants for the rounding modes of function round():

- PHP_ROUND_CEILING - rounds num to the nearest integer bigger than num,
- PHP_ROUND_FLOOR - rounds num to the nearest integer lower than num,
- PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO - rounds num away from zero,
- PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO - rounds num towards zero. 

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None

===== Proposed PHP Versions =====
8.4

===== Questions =====

==== Why not use functions ceil() and floor()? ====
The functions ceil() and floor() round numbers to the full integer, while the function round() roundes the number by given precision.

==== Why not the names PHP_ROUND_UP and PHP_ROUND_DOWN ====
Such constants already exist in the NumberFormatter and represent rounding modes 'away from zero' and 'toward zero'. However the names rounding up and down are not straightforward and thus I restrained from using them. 

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As per the voting RFC a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started on 2023-09-x and will end on 2023-09-x.
