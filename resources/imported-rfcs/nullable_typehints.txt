====== PHP RFC: Nullable Type-Hints ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-04-10 
  * Author: Levi Morrison <levim@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_typehints

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes the ability to allow null on type-hints through new syntax. 

Consider the function:

<PHP>
function foo(DateTime $time, $a) {
    // unimportant
}
</PHP>

In this situation you are not allowed to pass <php>null</php> to <php>$time</php> but can perhaps provide a sensible default; this proposal allows you do pass <php>null</php> without re-ordering the parameters.

===== Proposal =====

This proposal adds a mark <php>?</php> to indicate that a type-hint can also be <php>null</php>. This would be allowed for any type-hints including <php>array</php> and <php>callable</php> (not just objects); if the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/returntypehinting|return type RFC]] is accepted it would also work on return type-hints.

<PHP>
function foo(?DateTime $time, $a) {
    // unimportant
}
</PHP>

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC modifies the PHP language syntax and therefore requires a two-third majority of votes.
