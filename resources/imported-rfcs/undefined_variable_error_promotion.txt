====== PHP RFC: Undefined Variable Error Promotion ======
  * Version: 1
  * Date: 2022-02-17
  * Author: Mark Randall marandall@php.net
  * Status: Voting
  * Target: PHP 9.0
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/undefined_variable_error_promotion

===== Introduction =====
Undefined variables are those that have not yet been initialised with a value prior to being read. Accessing an undefined variable currently emits an E_WARNING "Warning: Undefined variable $varname" and treats the variable as if it were a null, but does not otherwise interrupt execution, allowing code execution to continue unabated, but likely in an unintended state.

Although a custom error handler can already be used to raise an Error exception, this requires additional userland code to configure, when instead we should be aiming to provide a safer experience by default. The need to support calling a custom error handler does itself also introduce additional complexity into the engine, leading  to "increasingly complex games" to keep it working (see "Benefits").

**RFC History / Previous Votes**

This change was last discussed during the Engine Warnings RFC (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings) where it received 56% in favour of making this behaviour an Error exception. It is likely that the only reason this vote failed to reach a supermajority at the time was because the condition was previously a notice, and some felt the jump from notice to error was too great for one version. Accessing undefined variables will have been a warning for 5+ years by the time this RFC would come into effect.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes that accessing an undefined variable is rendered illegal behaviour in the next major version of PHP, and will result in an Error exception being thrown if it occurs.

For the purposes of this RFC, accessing a variable means to use the variable in such a way that the engine attempts to read its value for use in an expression, without accounting for possibly being unset. These can be identified by the warning "Warning: Undefined variable $varname".

isset / empty / null coalesce DO account for undefined values and such are not covered by this RFC.

Undefined variable access can come about in one of 3 main ways:

**Mechanism 1.** 

The variable only becomes defined when executing certain branching code paths, for example setting a value within an if statement, or within anything which might include an if statement under the hood, such as a loop.

<code php>
  if ($user->admin) { 
     $restricted = false;
  }
  
  if ($restricted) { 
     die('You do not have permission to be here');
  }
</code>

**Mechanism 2.** 

A typo in the variable name. 

<code php>
  $name = 'Joe';
  echo 'Welcome, ' . $naame;
</code>

The above example shows a typo when reading the value, but consider also a typo when writing the value, that led to initializing the wrong variable, leaving the intended one uninitialized.

<code php>
  if ($user->admin) { 
     $restricted = false;
  } else { 
     $restrictedd = true;
  }
  
  if ($restricted) { 
     die('You do not have permission to be here');
  }
</code>

**Mechanism 3.** 

Accessing a variable for use with a post-increment operator $foo++ sometimes used with counters (as post-increment on null is special-cased).

<code php>
  while ($item = $itr->next()) { 
     /* do something */
     $counter++; /* potential undefined variable read #1 */
  }
  
  /* potential undefined variable read #2 which is the same as the 
   * first mechanism (variable undefined due to branching logic) */
  echo 'You scanned ' . $counter . ' items'; 
</code>

Of these 3 mechanisms, the first two are almost always unintentional bugs, and while the third can sometimes be a deliberate action, it too is often the result of a coding error.

If for some reason the null behaviour is desired, a simple backwards compatible solution is available, the author needs only to initialize the variable with a null prior to its use. It is expected that in many cases a more logical alternative would exist, such as initializing to zero, false, or empty string, depending on the context.  

<code php>
  $restricted = true;
  if ($user->admin) { 
     $restricted = false;
  }
  
  if ($restricted) { 
     die('You do not have permission to be here');
  }
</code>

<code php>
  $counter = 0;
  while ($item = $itr->next()) { 
     $counter++;
  }
  
  echo 'You scanned ' . $counter . ' items';
</code>


===== Benefits =====
The primary benefit for this change is to eliminate an entire class of userland bugs related to the consequences of accessing and using these undefined variables and their fallback to their engine-provided default. By doing so we offer another layer of protection against PHP applications continuing their execution after entering a likely unintended state.

While this alone should be enough, Nikita, author of the RFC that promoted access to an E_WARNING offered the following technical benefits to promoting to an error:

<blockquote>
The big problem with these (from a pure implementation perspective) is that we need to throw the warning and continue running. But the warning might call a custom error handler, which may modify state that the virtual machine does not expect to be modified. The PHP VM plays increasingly complex games to prevent this, but despite all that complexity, this problem cannot be fully solved while this remains a warning, rather than an exception.

Same goes for other warnings in the engine of course, undefined variables are just the biggest offender, because this particular warning can occur as part of nearly any operation. The additional complexities that arise when you combine this problem with a JIT compiler are left as an exercise to the reader.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Accessing an undefined variable will result in an Error exception being thrown.

Although accessing undefined variables has not been considered good practice for a long time, and has been an E_WARNING since  PHP 8 (which will be 5 years old by the time PHP 9 arrives) there will still be an amount of code out there that will experience additional errors being thrown as a result of this change.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This change is targeted for PHP 9.0. 

Although the target version is mandated by our traditional breaking changes policy, it is also the intent of this RFC to give multiple years of notice that this change will be coming, affording the greatest opportunity for developers to modify their code in anticipation of this change.

A minor change will be included in the next minor version to alter the existing warning message to indicate the warning will become an error in 9.0.


===== Unaffected Functionality =====
If the code does not currently emit a "Warning: Undefined variable $varname" then it is out of scope for this RFC. This RFC does NOT apply to array indexes.
