====== PHP RFC: Rounding Integers as int ======
  * Version: 0.2
  * Date: 2023-09-26
  * Author: Marc Bennewitz, php@mabe.berlin
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

PHP contains several build-in rounding functions [[https://www.php.net/round|round]], [[https://www.php.net/ceil|ceil]], [[https://www.php.net/floor|floor]] and [[https://www.php.net/number_format|number_format]].

Except ''number_format'' all of these functions take a ''float|int'', do a cast to ''float'', process on floating point number only and finally return a '' float''.

As a result of ''round'', ''ceil'' and ''floor'' you get a floating point number rounded to your needs.

In most cases this is sufficient but in cases of handling integer values above 2^53 you start to end up with unexpected results due to floating point arithmetic and precision loss.

''number_format'' on the other hand produces human readable numbers as ''string'' and since PHP 8.3 it also performs rounding integers without casting it to floating point numbers to fix the above issues mentioned.


===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to perform rounding on given int and return the resulting int if possible by default.
In case of integer under-/overflow the value will be casted to a float (double) and rounded based on the floating point number as it's done currently.

For ''ceil'', ''floor'' and ''round'' with ''precision >= 0'' this means a given int gets returned as is.

An additional argument will be introduced ''bool force_float''.
In PHP 8.next this will default to ''force_float=true'' to keep current behavior but the new behavior can already be used by passing ''force_float=false''.
In PHP 9.0 the default will change to ''force_float=true'' to get the new behavior by default but the previous behavior can be forced with ''force_float=true''.


The behavior will be as follows:
<code>
// No change, rounding floating point number will keep processing and returning float as it does now
ceil(float, force_float=false): float
ceil(float, force_float=true): float
floor(float, force_float=false): float
floor(float, force_float=true): float
round(float, force_float=false): float
round(float, force_float=true): float

// rounding integers with force_float=false will process and return int if possible
// else with force_float=true it will process on int but cast the result to float to keep previous behavior
ceil(int, force_float=false): int
ceil(int, force_float=true): float
floor(int, force_float=false): int
floor(int, force_float=true): float
round(int, precision: >= 0, force_float=false): int
round(int, precision: < 0, force_float=false): int|float // implicit cast to float only in case of integer under-/overflow
round(int, force_float=true): float

</code>

This will result in less implicit casts and more precise rounding of integers above 2^53.

The ''int''-type is compatible to ''float'', returning an int instead of a float will still be a number accepted for type-hints of ''int'', ''float'', ''int|float'' or ''mixed'' with strict_types enabled.

As a result PHP will behave more precise on rounding integer values.


===== Examples =====
<code php>
function takeFloat(float $v) { return $v; }
function returnFloat($v): float { return $v; }

var_dump(round(1));
var_dump(round(1.0));
var_dump(round(987654321098765432, precision: -3));
var_dump(round(987654321098765432, precision: -4)); // integer overflow
var_dump(takeFloat(round(987654321098765432, precision: -3)));
var_dump(returnFloat(round(987654321098765432, precision: -3)));
</code>

8.3 behavior (current):
<code>
float(1)
float(1)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
float(9.8765432109877E+17)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
</code>

8.4 behavior:
<code>
float(1)
float(1)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
float(9.8765432109877E+17)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
</code>

9.0 behavior (Changed default behavior):
<code>
int(1)
float(1)
int(987654321098765000)
float(9.8765432109877E+17)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
float(9.87654321098766E+17)
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

A BC break happens on type reporting functions like ''is_float'', ''get_debug_type'', ''gettype'' and strict comparison ''==='' will now report an int on rounding integers by default.

The old behavior can be forced by explicitly passing `force_float=true` argument or by explicitly casting the result back to float ''(float)round($num)''.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
  * Introduce new argument ''force_float=true'' in PHP 8.next
  * Change default to ''force_float=false'' as described in PHP 9.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Rounding floating point numbers will not be effected in any way.

===== Future Scope =====
After PHP 9 it can be considered to deprecate and remove the `force_float` argument again but due to very long future this is not part of this RFC.


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
One primary vote (requires 2/3 majority): Round on int and return int? 

===== Patches and Tests =====

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== Rejected Features =====

=== Add new functions ===

PHP is a loosely typed langue and as such it's extremely uncommon to have to call different rounding functions for rounding ''int'' vs. ''float''.
Also the normal ''round'' already does the trick and mostly you won't know better until you get bitten by floating point.
