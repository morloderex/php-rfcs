====== PHP RFC: Voting ======
  * Version: 2.0.0001
  * Date: 2017
  * Author: Zeev Suraski <zeev@php.net>
  * Status: Draft (or Under Discussion or Accepted or Declined)
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting2017


===== Introduction =====
This RFC amends and replaces https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting with the main goals of being clearer, more concise, and eliminating ambiguities as much as possible.

Specifically, this RFC does that via:
  * Clarifying and redefining voting thresholds
  * Clarifying and redefining voting workflows
  * Clarifying and redefining voting eligibility


===== Background =====

Since the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting|original Voting RFC]] was published back in 2011, it gradually became clear that the language in it is ambiguous, and in some cases - shortsighted.
To name some examples:
  * The definition of 'who gets a vote' was very fluid
  * The definition of which votes require a 2/3 majority and which ones don't was very fluid
  * The voting workflow text was very terse - and left elements such as 'canceled votes' unhandled and open for interpretation
  * Even the definition of what requires a vote in the first place was not clear

Because of its many shortcomings, this RFC does not attempt to 'fix' the original Voting RFC, but rather rewrite it - factoring in the lessons learned in the last 6+ years.

===== Proposal =====
Definitions:
**RFC**: Request For Comments for a proposed Change to PHP or for a Decision regarding PHP's Delivery.
**Change to PHP**:   Functionality that is added, changed, deprecated or removed from the PHP language.
**Decisions regarding PHP's Delivery**:  Decisions that deal with support timelines, release timelines or version numbering.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 7.x" or "next PHP 7.x.y".

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Will existing extensions be affected?

==== To Opcache ====
It is necessary to develop RFC's with opcache in mind, since opcache is a core extension distributed with PHP.

Please explain how you have verified your RFC's compatibility with opcache.

==== New Constants ====
Describe any new constants so they can be accurately and comprehensively explained in the PHP documentation.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

State whether this project requires a 2/3 or 50%+1 majority (see [[voting]])

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
