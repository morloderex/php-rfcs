===== Introduction =====

PHP's DOM extension supports loading HTML documents using the methods <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML</php> and <php>DOMDocument::loadHTMLFile</php>.
This uses libxml2's HTML parser under the hood to parse these documents into a libxml2 document tree that ext/dom uses.
Unfortunately, this parser only supports HTML up to version 4.01. This is a problem because HTML5 has become the de facto standard for websites over the past 10 years.
Introducing HTML5 parsing to PHP's DOM implementation is crucial for modernizing and enhancing PHP's capabilities in handling modern web content.

Using loadHTML(File) to load HTML5 content results in multiple parsing errors and incorrect document trees. These issues arise from changes in parsing rules between HTML4 and HTML5. Notably, the current parser does not recognize semantic HTML5 tags (e.g., main, article, section, ...) as valid tags. Then there's also problems with certain elements nestings not allowed in HTML4, but allowed in HTML5, causing incorrect document trees.
Another concern highlighted in PHP's bug tracker is the handling of closing tags within script contexts. With the common practice of embedding HTML within JavaScript, HTML4 parsers encounter problems with closing tags within JavaScript literals. Consequently, parsing through loadHTML(File) leads to incorrect document trees. The list of issues goes on and on. Not being able to parse HTML5 properly is one of the major pain points of our DOM extension.

There's an open issue at the libxml2 bugtracker to add HTML5 parsing support: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/211.
However, it seems like this won't happen anytime soon.
This RFC proposes leveraging an alternative HTML5 parser to create the libxml2 document tree. This will introduce two new methods: <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5(string $html, int $options=0)</php> and <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5File(string $path, int $options=0)</php>. This parser seamlessly integrates with the DOM extension, ensuring compatibility for all existing code and third-party extensions.

===== Proposal =====

The most important requirement is that the HTML5 parser must integrate seamlessly with the DOM extension. This means that using the HTML5 parser must be a simple drop-in replacement. You will still be able to use all the existing APIs to manipulate and traverse DOM documents and nodes.

We propose the introduction of two new methods <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5(string $html, int $options=0)</php> and <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5File(string $path, int $options=0)</php> instead of replacing the existing ones. This ensures full backwards compatibility for applications that work with legacy HTML4 documents, and want the HTML4 behaviour.

Serializing the document back to a string or to a file will be possible with the existing <php>DOMDocument::saveHTML</php> and <php>DOMDocument::saveHTMLFile</php> methods.

==== The options argument ====

Just like the existing load methods, these two new methods also take an optional options argument. The options for the load methods change the way the parser behaves. The only two options that will have an effect for the new methods are <php>LIBXML_HTML_NOIMPLIED</php> and <php>LIBXML_NOERROR</php>. Here's an overview why the other options are not implemented:

^ Option                        ^ Reasoning                                          ^
| <php>LIBXML_BIGLINES</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_PARSEHUGE</php>    | Not needed, this always works for the new methods. |
| <php>LIBXML_COMPACT</php>     | This is a transparent optimization for the program, not implemented right now because it requires quite a few hacks. It can be implemented in the future |
| <php>LIBXML_DTDATTR</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_DTDLOAD</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_DTDVALID</php> | There is only one valid DTD for HTML5, these options don't make sense. |
| <php>LIBXML_HTML_NODEFDTD</php>     | Not needed, this is the default HTML5 behaviour. |
| <php>LIBXML_NOBLANKS</php> | This doesn't remove blank nodes in all cases. There's rules that libxml2 follows based on whether the element accepts #PCDATA, and based on the position of the element. As HTML5 is not based on XML, there is no concept of #PCDATA. Hence, it is unclear how to implement this. |
| <php>LIBXML_NOCDATA</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_NOEMPTYTAG</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_NOENT</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_NSCLEAN</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_XINCLUDE</php> \\ <php>LIBXML_SCHEMA_CREATE</php> | This is only valid in XML, the concept doesn't exist in HTML5. |
| <php>LIBXML_NONET</php> | Not needed, the new methods never access the network. |
| <php>LIBXML_NOWARNING</php> | Not needed, only errors are reported, there's no concept of a warning because this is not a conformance checker. |
| <php>LIBXML_PEDANTIC</php> | Error reporting follows the spec, no custom modification is done. |

==== Additional background info ====

The DOM extensions supports both XML and HTML documents. It's built heavily upon libxml2's APIs and data structures, just like all XML-related PHP extensions within php-src. This is great for interopability (e.g. with simplexml and xsl).
Third-party extensions also use libxml2 APIs. For example, the [[https://pecl.php.net/package/xmldiff|xmldiff]] PECL extension peeks into the internals of DOMDocument to grab the libxml2 data structures and compare them.
It is not possible to switch away from the libxml2 library as the underlying basis for the DOM extension because that will cause a major BC break.

==== Approach ====

Parsing an HTML document via an HTML parser results in a document tree. The tree consists of HTML nodes. These nodes are structs on the heap created by the parser. In order to integrate an alternative parser into our DOM extension, these nodes need to be converted into libxml2 nodes. The resulting tree, after conversion, is then used in the DOM extension, just //as if// it had come from libxml2's parser.

The conversion is fairly straight-forward. We perform a depth-first traversal on the tree, checking the node type and creating the corresponding libxml2 node. The traversal is performed using iteration instead of recursion to prevent stack overflows with deep trees. After this process is done, we throw away the old tree and are left with only the libxml2 tree.

==== Choosing an HTML5 parser ====

We have to choose a suitable HTML5 parser. It should be spec-compliant, heavily tested, and fast.
I propose to use [[https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor|Lexbor]]. According to its README, it satisfies our requirements. Furthermore, it already has bindings for Elixir, Crystal, Python, D, and Ruby. This shows that it has been used in practice in other serious projects.

It is fully written in C99. That's ideal, because PHP is also using the C99 standard.
One small complication is that this library is not available in package managers for almost all distros. Therefore, I propose to bundle it with PHP. This also gives us the freedom to incorporate a patch to expose the line and column numbers of HTML nodes such that the error messages are richer and the <php>DOMNode::getLineNo()</php> function will work properly.
Bundling a library with PHP is not unprecedented, PHP already bundles e.g. pcre2lib, gd, libmagic.

Lexbor also supports overriding the allocation routines. Therefore, we can make it work with PHP's memory limit. Something that is currently not done with libxml2.

=== Alternative considered HTML5 parsers ===

Lexbor is one of several HTML5 parsers available. During my investigation, I considered two alternatives:

  * Gumbo: https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser.\\ A relatively well-known HTML5 parser developed by Google in C.\\ Unfortunately, it has been unmaintained since 2016, as indicated in its README, making it unsuitable for use.
  * html5ever: https://github.com/servo/html5ever.\\ This is Servo's HTML5 parser, written in Rust.\\ I have implemented a [[https://github.com/nielsdos/html5ever-libxml2-bridge/blob/main/src/lib.rs|proof-of-concept conversion]] from html5ever to libxml2, and a [[https://github.com/nielsdos/php-src/commits/dom-bridge|proof-of-concept integration with PHP]] on my fork.\\ \\ I decided to not go with this option for a few reasons.\\ * Firstly, while writing it in Rust would enhance memory safety (especially for untrusted documents), introducing Rust as an additional dependency for PHP adds extra complexity. PHP's default-enabled extensions can currently be built using only C, but if we go this route this would change.\\ * Secondly, the implementation is incomplete, primarily the lack of alternative character encoding support is problematic: it currently only supports UTF-8 documents. Support for other text encodings is lacking, necessitating a prior conversion. Moreover, reparsing logic for character encoding meta tags is absent.\\ * Lastly, observing the commit activity raises doubts about the ongoing activity of this project.

Considering these factors, I opted against using the above two. Lexbor emerged as the better choice after this investigation.

=== A note on conformance checkers ===

I want to emphasize that the HTML5 parser is //not// a conformance checkers. Conformance checkers check for additional rules in addition to the parsing rules. Browsers, and the proposed loadHTML5 methods, //only// perform the parsing rules checks. An example of something that's fine for a HTML5 parser, but not fine for a conformance checker is the following document:

''<!doctype html><html><head></head><body></body></html>''

This is perfectly valid for a parser. Our implementation won't report any errors. Conformance checkers, however, will report the lack of a title element (amongst some other minor things).

==== Error handling ====

When parsing a document, potential parse errors may occur. With the existing load methods of DOMDocument, a parser error results in an E_WARNING by default. //However//, you can use <php>libxml_use_internal_errors(true)</php> to store the errors inside an array. In this case, no warning will be generated and the parse errors may be inspected using <php>libxml_get_errors()</php> and <php>libxml_get_last_error()</php>.

The naming of these methods is a bit unfortunate. These methods have become almost synonymous with handling DOMDocument parse errors.
To offer a seamless HTML5 parser replacement, my current implementation follows the same error handling as described above.
That means, by default we will emit an E_WARNING. If <php>libxml_use_internal_errors(true)</php> is used then the errors will be stored, and can be retrieved in the same way as described above. This may seem unconventional since the errors originate from Lexbor rather than libxml2. However, we have good reasons to do so.

The alternative would be to introduce methods specific to getting the errors from the HTML5 parser.
However, I do not believe that's a good idea because:
  - The developers utilising these new parsing methods don't necessarily know that it uses Lexbor. So they expect the error handling behaviour to be the same as the existing methods.
  - The proposed approach makes it easier to use as a drop-in replacement.
  - If libxml2 ever introduces its own HTML5 parser, we can drop Lexbor and nothing changes for the end user w.r.t. error handling.

==== External entity loader ====

XML supports something called "external entities". This will load data from an external source into the current document (if enabled). Because you might want to customise the external entity handling, there's a <php>libxml_set_external_entity_loader(?callable $resolver_function)</php> function to setup a custom "resolver". This "resolver" returns either a path, a stream resource, or null. In the former two cases, the entity will be loaded from the path or stream. In the latter case, the loading will be blocked.

This interacts a bit surprisingly with the existing loadHTMLFile method. You can observe this here: https://3v4l.org/rJTTc.
The loadHTMLFile method considers loading the file also as loading an external entity, hence the "resolver" is invoked.

There's a (deprecated) similar function <php>libxml_disable_entity_loader(bool $disable)</php> that completely disables loading external entities.
This function has been perceived as broken by the community due to it blocking loading anything that's not coming from a string. See https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5867 for more details.
I don't know how the community perceives the interaction between loadHTMLFile and <php>libxml_set_external_entity_loader</php>.

Unlike XML, HTML5 does not have a concept of external entities.
The question I have is whether <php>libxml_set_external_entity_loader</php> should affect loadHTML5File in the same way as it does loadHTMLFile.
The advantage would be consistency, but I don't know if this is what the community wants.
I'm leaving this for a secondary vote for the community to decide on.

==== Parsing benchmarks ====

You might wonder about the performance impact of the tree conversion. In particular, how does the performance of <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5</php> compare with the performance of <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML()</php>? Note that the latter method doesn't follow the HTML5 rules, but it does give an indication about the performance.

=== Experimental setup ===

I downloaded the homepages of the top 50 websites (excluding blank pages and NSFW pages) as listed according to [[https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/|similarweb]]. This means 43 websites remain: 6 NSFW sites, and one blank page (microsoftonline.com) were removed.
I created a PHP script that invokes each parser 1000 times. I ran the experiment on an i7-4790 with 16GiB RAM.

=== Results ===

The following graph shows the results. The blue bar shows the parse time in seconds for loadHTML, and the orange bar does so for loadHTML5.
The black vertical line indicates the minimum & maximum measured times for each bar.
First of all, some measurements on the far left are very low. That's because those sites primarily generate their content using JavaScript. Hence, there are not many HTML nodes in the document. Some sites also show a geo-blocked page, so these pages are rather simple and will be parsed quickly.
Second, we can see that loadHTML5 is consistently faster than the existing loadHTML method, despite having to do a conversion.

Based on this limited experiment, I conclude that the performance is acceptable.

==== Impact on binary size ====

Incorporating any library will increase the binary size of the DOM extension. The Lexbor library is fairly big.
The reality is however that a lot of the library is not actually used.
Diving into each source file and ripping out functions that are not used is time-consuming and difficult however. Furthermore, this would make syncing upstream changes also more difficult.

Inspecting the dom.so shared library using the size command yields the following results:

^ before/after        ^ text       ^ data       ^ total       ^
| before this patch   | 174.78 KiB | 15.18 KiB  | 192.24 KiB  |
| after this patch    | 738.03 KiB | 584.63 KiB | 1325.12 KiB |

The large data section is due to the large lookup tables for text encoding handling: Lexbor supports a lot of text encodings. The HTML5 parser spec requires quite a few character encodings to be supported by a compliant parser.

==== Completely alternative solution ====

This section will list alternative solutions that I considered, but rejected.

=== Alternative DOM extension ===

One might wonder why we don't just create an entirely new DOM extension, based on another library, with HTML5 support.
There are a couple of reasons:
  - Interopability problems with other extensions (both within php-src and third-party).
  - Fragmentation of userland.
  - Additional maintenance work and complexity.
  - I don't have time to do build this.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This RFC adds two new methods, but the existing methods for loading HTML4 documents remain as-is.
Therefore, this feature is purely opt-in, and there is no BC break.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x. At the time of writing this is PHP 8.4.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Only ext/dom is affected.

==== To Opcache ====

No impact.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

None yet.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything outside of ext/dom is unaffected.

===== Future Scope =====

This section details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

The Lexbor library also includes functionality outside of HTML parsing that we do not use right now.
  - It contains a CSS selector parser, that transforms the expression into a list of actions we must follow to find the elements. This //could// make implementing querySelector(All) more easy.
  - It contains a WHATWG-compliant URL parser, which might be useful for extending PHP's URL pasing capabilities.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

There are two votes:
  - Whether <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5(string $html, int $options=0)</php> and <php>DOMDocument::loadHTML5File(string $path, int $options=0)</php> should be introduced. This requires 2/3 majority.
  - Whether loadHTML5File should respect the resolver set by <php>libxml_set_external_entity_loader</php>. This requires 50% majority.

===== Patches and Tests =====

  - Pull request: https://github.com/nielsdos/php-src/pull/32 (TODO: move this to php-src)
  - Try it out yourself: https://gist.github.com/nielsdos/139099c54ddc4a43bc66f4c0b7ef02fc

This does not yet include the external entity loader support.
I want to wait until we have the results of the secondary vote before I spend time coding this part.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====

None yet.

===== Rejected Features =====

None yet.
