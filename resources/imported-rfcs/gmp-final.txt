====== PHP RFC: Make the GMP class final ======

  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2024-06-29
  * Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Voting
  * Target Version: PHP 8.4
  * Implementation: TBD
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/gmp-final

===== Introduction =====

The <php>GMP</php> class was introduced as part of the
[[rfc:operator_overloading_gmp|Internal operator overloading and GMP improvements]]
RFC.

This RFC also converted the GMP extension to use an object instead of a resource.
One of the first proposals of its kind.
Since then numerous resources have been converted to what we call opaque objects. [1][2][3]
And the finalization of the process was codified in the
[[rfc:resource_to_object_conversion|Resource to object conversion]]
RFC which was accepted in late 2023.

One element of the resource to object migration is to make the object opaque,
which in general implied, being <php>final</php>, being not serializable,
not constructible via <php>new</php>, cannot be cast, and to not implement any methods.

The <php>GMP</php> class is a notable exception to many of the above restrictions.
It is a non-final class, that can be instantiated via <php>new</php>, and is serializable.
The serialization aspect was intended as part of the initial RFC,
but the other aspects were not.
Indeed, the <php>GMP</php> class did not have a proper constructor to initialize the object until
PHP 8.2.4 after this fact was discovered and discussed on the mailing list in late December 2022. [4]

As such, we deem the fact that <php>GMP</php> was not made <php>final</php> an oversight and want to correct this.

===== Proposal =====

Make the <php>GMP</php> class final.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Any userland class that extends <php>GMP</php> would now throw a compile time error.

From an analysis of private and publicly available code bases with [[https://www.exakat.io/en/|Exakat]]
no one has ever extended this class, as such the BC Break is mostly theoretical.

===== Further Motivation =====

In the discussion of the new <php>BCMath\Number</php> class introduced via the
[[rfc:support_object_type_in_bcmath|Support object type in BCMath]]
RFC, it was //explicitly// discussed if the class should be <php>final</php> or not.
And the consensus was that it should be <php>final</php> due to concerns about overloading the methods.

However, people seemingly want to "enhance" <php>GMP</php> to achieve userland operator overloading
by hooking into it's logic when extending it.
This is in total contradiction with the above RFC discussion which happened a few months ago.
This resembles more of a "hack" than anything else and support for a proper form of operator overloading [5][6]
should be revisited instead.
Another alternative would be to create a dedicated PHP extension with an object that overloads the <php>do_operator</php> object handler.

Therefore, we think it is crucial to close this avenue for discussion once and for all.

===== Version =====

Next minor version, which is PHP 8.4.

===== Vote =====

As per the voting RFC a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started on 2024-07-13 and will end on 2024-07-27.
