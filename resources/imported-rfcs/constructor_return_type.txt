  * Date: 2020-06-14

  * Status: Draft
  * Target version: PHP 8.0

===== Introduction =====
RFC proposes to allow using ''void'' return type on constructors and destructors (e. g. for consistency with other methods, alternative code style, etc.). In a way, this proposal is like a trailing comma: some might use it, some might not, but both cases are valid and allowed.

===== Proposal =====
==== Explicit declaration ====
...

==== Consistency with other methods ====
...

==== __clone() allows void return type ====
...

==== PHP manual documents these methods as void ====
...

Note: only as part of the "Ensure correct signatures of magic methods" RFC.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None.

To ensure backwards compatibility, it is allowed to not specify a return type at all. Although, since no return type is ''mixed|void'', it is not allowed to narrow the return type to ''mixed'', only ''void''.

===== Vote =====
2/3 majority Yes/No.

===== Implementation =====
