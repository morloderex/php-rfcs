====== PHP RFC: Prevent number_format() from returning negative zero ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2017-04-01
  * Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
  * Proposed version: PHP 7.2
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

Calling ''number_format(-0.00)'' returns ''string(1) "0"'', however calling ''number_format(-0.01)'' returns ''string(2) "-0"''.

As ''number_format()'' is commonly used for formatting numbers for human-readable display, this behaviour is unexpected.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes keeping ''number_format()'' consistent and not displaying the sign when a number is rounded to zero.

===== Concerns =====

There was an argument that all floating point logic in PHP follows IEEE 754, where negative zero is valid.

However ''number_format()'' already prevents negative zero, so this isn't the case.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This change has BC concerns for anybody relying on the current behaviour, but this is thought to be incredibly minor and not unrealistic for a point release.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.2

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires 50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'. 

===== Implementation =====
