====== PHP RFC: Change terminology to AllowList and BlockList ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2020-06-09
  * Author: Micha≈Ç Marcin Brzuchalski <brzuchal@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/change-terminology-to-allowlist-and-blocklist

Change uses of "whitelist" and "blacklist" with better self-descriptive terminology.

===== Introduction =====
Words like "whitelist" and "blacklist" require additional context to figure out the exact intention.
We should name things better because we can.

Words like "whitelist" and "blacklist" may have casually a pejorative wording.
There are no reasons to use these if we can find better naming terminology.

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to replace all occurrences of "whitelist" and "blacklist" to their respective alternatives "allowlist" and "blocklist".
A list of Open Source projects with similar terminology change is listed in [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/change-terminology-to-allowlist-and-blocklist#references|references]] section.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Most of the changes are internal only with two exceptions for which this patch requires RFC:

  - ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' INI directive
  - ''opcache_get_configuration()["blacklist"]'' key in returned array value

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP version 8.0.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Only in Opcache.

==== To Opcache ====
This proposal modifies Opcache structure and function names by replacing "blacklist" with "blocklist".

==== php.ini Defaults ====

  * php.ini-development changed name of ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' into ''opcache.blocklist_filename''
  * php.ini-production changed name of ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' into ''opcache.blocklist_filename''
