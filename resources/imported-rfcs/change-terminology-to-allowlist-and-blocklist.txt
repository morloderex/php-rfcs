  * Version: 0.9

  * Author: Micha≈Ç Marcin Brzuchalski <brzuchal@php.net>

  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/change-terminology-to-allowlist-and-blocklist

Change uses of "whitelist" and "blacklist" with better self-descriptive terminology.

===== Introduction =====
The cultural significance of blacklists is based on racial discrimination.
There are no reasons to use these.

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to replace all occurrences of "whitelist" and "blacklist" to their respective alternatives "allowlist" and "blocklist".
This proposal was inspired by movement in changing terminology in other Open Source projects [1].

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Most of the changes are internal only with two exceptions for which this patch requires RFC:

  - ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' INI directive
  - ''opcache_get_configuration()["blacklist"]'' key in returned array value

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP version 8.0.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Only in Opcache.

==== To Opcache ====
This proposal modifies Opcache structure and function names by replacing "blacklist" with "blocklist".

==== php.ini Defaults ====

  * php.ini-development changed name of ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' into ''opcache.blocklist_filename''
  * php.ini-production changed name of ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' into ''opcache.blocklist_filename''

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
