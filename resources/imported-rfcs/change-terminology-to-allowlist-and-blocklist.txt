====== PHP RFC: Change terminology to AllowList and BlockList ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2020-06-09
  * Author: Micha≈Ç Marcin Brzuchalski <brzuchal@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/change-terminology-to-allowlist-and-blocklist

Change uses of "whitelist" and "blacklist" in Opcache configuration with better self-descriptive terminology.

===== Introduction =====
The words "whitelist" and "blacklist" require additional context to figure out the exact intention of a specific
configuration. This proposal suggest to change these to names that better reflect what the functionality does.

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to replace all occurrences of "whitelist" and "blacklist" to their respective alternatives "allowlist" and "blocklist".

A list of Open Source projects with similar terminology change is listed in [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/change-terminology-to-allowlist-and-blocklist#references|references]] section. There is also a draft [[https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html|IETF document]].

==== Change INI directive name ====
A new INI directive called ''opcache.blocklist_filename'' will be introduced and will configure the same internal value as the already existing ''opcache.blacklist_filename''.

The INI directive called ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' will remain as is but with additional soft-deprecation in the docs and 
in ''php.ini-development'' and ''php.ini-production''.

==== Change in opcache_get_configuration function ====
The ''opcache_get_configuration()'' function currently returns an associative array with information about Opcache.
A new key named ''blocklist'' will be added to resulting array with the same value as the original ''blacklist''
key which will remain untouched with additional soft-deprecation in the docs.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Most of the changes are internal only with two exceptions for which this patch requires RFC:

  - The new ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' INI directive
  - An extra ''blacklist'' key in the returned array value of ''opcache_get_configuration()''

Whether the use of the ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' INI directive triggers a deprecation notice is a subject to a secondary vote.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP version 8.0.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Only in Opcache.

==== To Opcache ====
This proposal modifies Opcache structure and function names by replacing "blacklist" with "blocklist".

==== php.ini Defaults ====

  * php.ini-development changed name of ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' into ''opcache.blocklist_filename''
  * php.ini-production changed name of ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' into ''opcache.blocklist_filename''

===== Future scope =====
The possibility to remove ''opcache.blacklist_filename'' INI directive and ''opcache_get_configuration()["blacklist"]'' in the next
minor PHP version: 8.1.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Accept changing terminology in PHP 8.0? Yes/No with 2/3 majority required.
Add deprecation notice when deprecated INI directive used? Yes/No
