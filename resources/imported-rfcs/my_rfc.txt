**This is not your RFC.**

If you came here from the [[rfc:howto]] page expecting to start a new RFC here, you've misunderstood. You need to **pick a unique URL for your RFC**, beginning ''https://wiki.php.net/rfc/'', that hasn't already been used.

If you came here looking for //someone else's RFC//, look at [[:rfc|the RFC index page]].
