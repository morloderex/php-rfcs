===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to propose adding functionality to Reflection which will augment Reflection::getDocComment() with a new function that will parse the DocComment string, providing a simple, standardized mechanism of retrieving metadata.

==== Why do we need metadata? ====

Metadata is data which provides additional description about a structure. In PHP, this can be used for many purposes:
  * **Type Information** - Since PHP is a loosely typed language, there is currently no venue for encoding expected type information for use in, e.g. validation or sanitization routines.
  * **Relationships** - In an application with many model-type classes, there almost always exist many relationships between the models that go beyond the parent-child one modeled by class inheritance. For example, the "foreign key" concept from relational databases is one such set of relationships (e.g. one-to-one, one-to-many, etc) and is important in ORM-type programs.
  * **Other** - Unfortunately, most of the use cases fall into the "other" category, and in truth the use cases for metadata often fall into a grey area: all information contained in metadata //could be contained within the structure itself//. The question is whether or not it could be more elegantly and appropriately contained elsewhere.

For other use cases, see also [[http://wiki.php.net/rfc/annotations|the Annotations RFC]].

==== Why should the PHP engine do this? ====

1. There is already a widely used syntax for structured DocBlocks (short description, long description, tags using the @ symbol).
2. For metadata to be the most
