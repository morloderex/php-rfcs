====== PHP RFC: base_convert changes ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-05-15
  * Author: Scott Dutton,php@exussum.co.uk
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/base_convert_improvements



===== Introduction =====
the base_convert family of functions(base_convert, bin2hex, hex2bin etc) are very accepting with their input arguments, you can pass any string to to them and they give a best effort of converting it.

For example base_convert("hello world", 16, 10); will return 237 with no warnings. What this does internally is base_convert("ed", 16, 10); 

Also negative numbers simply do not work, eg base_convert("-ff", 16, 10); will return 255.

===== Proposal =====
II propose two changes to the base_convert family of functions. 

=== Error on truncation ===
When passed arguments that base_convert will ignore, also give a warning to the user.
There is an exception in place for the second char, if base is 16 x is allowed eg 0xff, base 2 allows b and base 8 allows o.
This can be raised to a full exception for a later PHP version (eg PHP 8)

=== Allow negative arguments ===
Negative numbers should be allowed to be passed to the base_convert family of functions. for example base_convert('-ff', 16', 10); should return -255. Currently users need to make an exception in this case


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
=== Error on truncation ===
No BC breaks for a warning, in the case of an exception there will be a BC break - Would suggest PHP 8 for this.

=== Allow negative arguments ===
base_convert currently in the backend has a zend_ulong as its representation. We would need a zend_long. This will change the behavior of numbers in the range 9223372036854775807 - 18446744073709551615 but will allow negative numbers.

This currently breaks a fair amount of unit tests that I will need to update if this change is accepted.  The unit tests are around extreme values
