====== PHP RFC: Replacing current json extension with jsond ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-01-01
  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft


===== Introduction =====
The current Json Parser in the json extension does not have a free license which is a problem for many Linux distros. The extension code is also very old which makes it difficult for further improvements. There also are some implementation decisions that makes the performance worse than it should be

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to replace current json extension with code that is based on the PECL jsond extension (it's not exactly the same code as there are some modification for PHP 7).

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
  * Rejected ECMA-404 and RFC 7159 incompatible number formats in json_decode string
    * top level (PHP json_decode check): 07, 0xff, .1, -.1
    * all (JSON_Parser): [1.], [1.e1]

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No impact

==== To Existing Extensions ====
In addition to the backward incompatible changes for float number format the following internal changes have been done:
  * removed JSON_parser.h header
  * removed utf8_decode.h header
  * macro JSON_PARSER_DEFAULT_DEPTH renamed to PHP_JSON_PARSER_DEFAULT_DEPTH
  * error codes constants moved to php_json.h
    * enum error_codes renamed to php_json_error_codes (typedef)
    * ext global error_code type changed from int to php_json_error_codes

==== To Opcache ====
No impact

==== New Constants ====
None

===== Open Issues =====
Not yet

===== Future Scope =====
  * Improving performance for encoder and decoder
  * Better error reporting (location of the error)

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
50%+1 majority

===== Patches and Tests =====
