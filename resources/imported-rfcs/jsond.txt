====== PHP RFC: Replacing current json extension with jsond ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-01-01
  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft


===== Introduction =====
The Parser for the current json extension does not have a free license which is a problem for many Linux distros. The extension code is also very old which makes it difficult for further improvements. There also are some implementation decisions that makes the performance worse than it should be

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to replace current json extension with code based on the PECL jsond extension (it's not exactly the same as there are some modification for PHP 7).

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There is a checking surrogates in the standalone string (string that is not contained in the object or array). This is more fix because the string in objects and arrays are handled in the same way as standalone string.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No impact

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No impact

==== To Opcache ====
No impact

==== New Constants ====
There is a new error... (todo: add)

===== Open Issues =====
No

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
There should be no changes from the User space except the one described above

===== Future Scope =====
Performance for encoder

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
50%+1 majority
