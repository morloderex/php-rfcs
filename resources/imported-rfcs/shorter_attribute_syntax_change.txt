====== PHP RFC: Shorter Attribute Syntax Change ======
  * Version: 0.0.1
  * Date: 2020-07-22
  * Author: Joe Ferguson, svpernova09@php.net, Derick Rethans
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change

===== Introduction =====
Based on the expressions of concern over using `@@` for Shorter Attribute Syntax RFC https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax, I propose to use `#[]` instead.

Concerns are:
  * The @@ syntax causes parser conflicts that were not made clear in the original RFC.
    * Note: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/namespaced_names_as_token will resolve these conflicts, and at the time of this writing will pass when voting closes on 2020-07-31
  * There are lots of concerns in the wider community. Some voiced on [https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/hjpu79/it_is/)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/hjpu79/it_is/), and many people replied positively towards [Derickâ€™s tweet](https://twitter.com/derickr/status/1285912223639130114).
  * It has the distinct possibility to cause further parsing issues.
  * There is no "end symbol" to make finding occurrences easier.
  * It is a syntax *no other language* uses.
  * @ is never going to go away, so the possibility of @@ moving to @ is also 0.


===== Proposal =====
We keep the Shorter Attribute Syntax RFC as is, except instead of implementing `@@` as the syntax, we use the 2nd ranked vote winner `#[]`.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The `#[]` syntax will be a breaking change as it currently is a comment, and after this implementation would no longer be a comment.
The @@ is also breaking change, however, as currently @@ is the shut-up operator twice.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.0

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
The vote will be to decide whether or not to accept `#[]` syntax instead of `@@` for the Shorter Attribute Syntax RFC.

===== Patches and Tests =====

Preliminary implementation: https://gist.github.com/beberlei/a2aba25b7f8356a80db4d3f114182ffc

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain
  * the version(s) it was merged into
  * a link to the git commit(s)
  * a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  * a link to the language specification section (if any)
