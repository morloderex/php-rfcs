====== PHP RFC: Shorter Attribute Syntax Change ======
  * Version: 2.0

===== Introduction =====

Based on the expressions of concern over using ''@@'' for Shorter Attribute Syntax RFC https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax, I propose to use ''#[]'', ''@[]'', or the original ''<<>>''  instead. Please keep in mind that we want the best syntax, and not necessarily the best **looking** syntax.

The main concern is that it that ''@@'' has **no ending symbol** and its **inconsistent** with the language that it would be the only declaration or statement in the whole language that has no ending termination symbol.

A matrix:

^ Syntax                             ^ ''@@Attr'' ^ ''#[Attr]'' ^ ''@[Attr]'' ^ ''<<Attr>>'' ^
| Number of required Characters      | 2      | 3       | 3       | 4        |
| Has End Delimiter                  | No     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      |
| Allows Grouping (Accepted in previous RFC) | No     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      |
| Forward Compatibilty in PHP 7      | No     | Yes     | No      | No       |
| Breaks BC of valid PHP 7 code      | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | No       |
| Used by other language             | No     | Yes     | No      | Yes      |
| Familiar with Docblock Usage       | Yes    | No      | No      | No       |
| Difficulties with Userland Parsers | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | No       |
| Target                             | 8.0    | 8.0     | 8.0     | 8.0      |
| Patch                              |        |         | [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5928|patch]] | |
