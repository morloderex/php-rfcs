====== PHP RFC: Improve HTML escape ======

===== Introduction =====

HTML escape can be improved by escaping "/".

OWASP [[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.231_-_HTML_Escape_Before_Inserting_Untrusted_Data_into_HTML_Element_Content
|recommends]] "/" escape.

User may do

  <tag attr=<?php htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') ?>>

When this is the case, HTML structure is broken. It's broken in first place, but it would not be good to destroy tag structure while we can avoid it.

It's better to escape all chars recommended by OWASP. 


===== Proposal =====

Add "/" escape by default for htmlentities()/htmlspecialchars().

Make ENT_QUOTES as a default. (Currently ENT_COMPAT is the default).

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None for most applications.

Since output differs, there might be test program issues.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.4 and up

or

PHP 5.6 and up


===== Open Issues =====

Which version to introduce.
