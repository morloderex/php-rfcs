====== PHP RFC: Improve HTML escape ======

===== Introduction =====

HTML escape can be improved by escaping "/".

OWASP recommends "/" escape.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.231_-_HTML_Escape_Before_Inserting_Untrusted_Data_into_HTML_Element_Content

User may do

  <tag attr=<?php htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') ?>>

When this is the case, HTML structure is broken. It's broken in first place, but it would not be good to destroy tag structure while we can avoid it.

===== Proposal =====

Add "/" escape by default for htmlentities()/htmlspecialchars()

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None for most applications.

Since output differs, there might be test program issues.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.4 and up

or

PHP 5.6 and up


===== Open Issues =====

Which version to introduce.
