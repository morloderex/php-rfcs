====== PHP RFC: Add get_declared_enums() function ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2024-08-19
  * Author: Juliette Reinders Folmer (php.net_nospam@adviesenzo.nl), Ayesh Karunaratne (ayesh@php.watch)
  * Status: Draft
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/15443
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/get_declared_enums


===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to add a new ''get_declared_enums()'' function in the next PHP 8.x release and to make the behaviour of the related functions consistent by:
  * Deprecating support for enums in the <php>class_exists()</php> function in the next PHP 8.x and removing support for enum from <php>class_exists()</php> in PHP 9.0.
  * Soft deprecating retrieving enums via the <php>get_declared_classes()</php> function and to remove enums from the return value of <php>get_declared_classes()</php> in PHP 9.0.

===== Proposal =====

There are four different OO structures in PHP:
  * Classes
  * Interfaces
  * Traits
  * Enums

For all four, a ''*_exists()'' function is available, i.e. <php>class_exists()</php>, <php>interface_exists()</php>, <php>trait_exists()</php> and <php>enum_exists()</php>.

But only for three out of the four, a ''get_declared_*()'' function exists.
There is <php>get_declared_classes()</php>, <php>get_declared_interfaces()</php>, <php>get_declared_traits()</php>, but no ''get_declared_enums()''.

This proposal intends to remedy this by adding a ''get_declared_enums()'' function in the next PHP 8.x release.

Furthermore, the behaviour of the <php>get_declared_classes()</php> and <php>class_exists()</php> functions is inconsistent, as <php>get_declared_classes()</php> currently //also// returns the names of enums and <php>class_exists()</php> returns ''true'' for both classes as well as enums.

To illustrate:

^ Function/Given  ^  Class  ^  Interface  ^  Trait  ^  Enum  ^
^ <php>class_exists()</php>  |  **true/false**  |  false  |  false  |  **true/false**  |
^ <php>interface_exists()</php>  |  false  |  **true/false**  |  false  |  false  |
^ <php>trait_exists()</php>  |  false  |  false  |  **true/false**  |  false  |
^ <php>enum_exists()</php>  |  false  |  false  |  false  |  **true/false**  |

Demo: https://3v4l.org/1PWFo

^ Function/Returns  ^  Classes  ^  Interfaces  ^  Traits  ^  Enums  ^
^ <php>get_declared_classes()</php>  |  **yes**  |  no  |  no  |  **yes**  |
^ <php>get_declared_interfaces()</php>  |  no  |  **yes**  |  no  |  no  |
^ <php>get_declared_traits()</php>  |  no  |  no  |  **yes**  |  no  |
^ ''get_declared_enums()'' (proposed)  |  no  |  no  |  no  |  **yes**  |

Demo: https://3v4l.org/0ub6I

This means that these functions do not act as the "silos" they appear to be, which can be a cause of bugs and other surprises.

To remedy this, a deprecation notice will be added when <php>class_exists()</php> is used with an enum name.
As of PHP 9.0, <php>class_exists()</php> will no longer act on enum names and return ''false'' for those.

As for <php>get_declared_classes()</php>, the proposal is to //soft// deprecate the return value including enum names, and to change the return value to no longer include enum names as of PHP 9.0.

===== Discussion =====

==== Why was get_declared_enums() not added when enums were added in PHP 8.1 ? ====

[[https://externals.io/message/124937#124941|According to Larry Garfield]] (one of the authors of the [[enumerations|enumerations RFC]]):

> I can't remember the last time I used ''get_declared_classes()'' [...], so when we were working on enums it never occurred to us to think about it. It wasn't a deliberate decision to omit, as far as I recall.

In other words: it appears to have been just an oversight. Not an intentional design choice.


==== Enums are a sub-set of classes, why should the behaviour of get_declared_classes() be changed ? ====

For the lack of a ''get_declared_enums()'' function, it is fortunate that <php>get_declared_classes()</php> includes enums in its return value, as otherwise there would be no way, at this time, to retrieve the list of enum symbols.

However, once the ''get_declared_enums()'' function would be introduced, this behaviour becomes inconsistent and surprising.

After all, internally, classes, interfaces, traits and enums are all considered classes, so why should <php>get_declared_classes()</php> include enums, but not interfaces and traits ?

Changing the return value of <php>get_declared_classes()</php>, however, constitutes a BC-break for the (limited) set of users consciously using <php>get_declared_classes()</php> to //also// retrieve the names of declared enum symbols.
With that in mind, changing the return value of <php>get_declared_classes()</php> is proposed for PHP 9.0.


==== Enums are a sub-set of classes, why should the behaviour of class_exists() be changed ? ====

Along the same lines as the above: interface and traits are also classes internally, but calling <php>class_exists()</php> on an interface or trait name will return ''false'', while calling it on an enum name will return ''true''.

This is inconsistent and surprising behaviour which this RFC intends to fix.


==== Why only soft deprecate the change to the return value for get_declared_classes() ? ====

The function itself is not deprecated, but the return value will change to not include enums.

As, when the function is called, there is no way to know how the return value will be used, it seems inappropriate to throw a deprecation notice.


==== What does soft deprecate even mean in this context ? ====

A warning about the upcoming change in the return value of <php>get_declared_classes()</php> in both the ''UPGRADING'' document, the migration guide, and on the manual page for <php>get_declared_classes()</php>.


==== Were any alternative approaches considered ? ====

[[https://externals.io/message/124937#125028|Claude Pache]] brought up the following alternative approach on the mailing list:
<code php>
const SIMPLE_CLASS = 1;
const ABSTRACT_CLASS = 2;
const ANONYMOUS_CLASS = 4;
const ENUM = 8;

function get_declared_classes(int $type = SIMPLE_CLASS | ABSTRACT_CLASS | ANONYMOUS_CLASS | ENUM): array { /* ... */ }
</code>

This approach could even be extrapolated to the following:
<code php>
const SIMPLE_CLASSES = 1;
const ABSTRACT_CLASSES = 2;
const ANONYMOUS_CLASSES = 4;
const INTERFACES = 8;
const TRAITS = 16;
const ENUMS = 32;

function get_declared_symbols(?int $type = null, bool $categorize = false): array { /* ... */ }
</code>

This would then allow for deprecating - and eventually removing - the <php>get_declared_classes()</php>, <php>get_declared_interfaces()</php> and <php>get_declared_traits()</php> methods in favour of the unified ''get_declared_symbols()'' method.

Deprecating and removing the <php>get_declared_classes()</php>, <php>get_declared_interfaces()</php> and <php>get_declared_traits()</php> methods would, however, be more disruptive to userland than the current proposal, which is why the current proposal prevailed.



===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

==== Introduction of the new function ====

The introduction of the new function means the name can no longer be used in userland code (without a <php>function_exists()</php> wrapper).

A GitHub code search yielded [[https://github.com/search?q=get_declared_enums+language%3APHP+&type=code|zero matches]] on public GitHub repositories that define a function with the same name.

If so desired, it is possible to polyfill the new ''get_declared_enums()'' function (props [[https://externals.io/message/124937#124973|Christoph M. Becker]] and [[https://externals.io/message/124937#124980|Nicolas Grekas]]):
<code php>
function get_declared_enums(): array {
    $enums = [];
    $exts = get_loaded_extensions(false);
    foreach ($exts as $ext) {
        $re = new ReflectionExtension($ext);
        $classes = $re->getClasses();
        foreach ($classes as $class) {
            if ($class->isEnum()) {
                $enums[] = $class->name;
            }
        }
    }
    return $enums;
}
</code>

<code php>
function get_declared_enums(): array {
     return array_filter(get_declared_classes(), 'enum_exists');
}
</code>

==== Deprecation of using class_exists() on enum names ====

The <php>enum_exists()</php> function has been included in PHP since PHP 8.1, when enums were introduced.
Code specifically intended to check whether an enum exists, will (or should) be using the <php>enum_exists()</php> function already.

There may be some code, which intentionally uses <php>class_exists()</php> as a convenient catch-all to check for both classes as well as enums, such code could be adjusted per the below to be cross-version compatible (and avoid the deprecation notice):
<code diff>
-if (class_exists($name)) {}
+if (enum_exists($name) || class_exists($name)) {}
</code>


==== Change of the return value of get_declared_classes() ====

As of PHP 9.0, existing code which explicitly relies on <php>get_declared_classes()</php> to retrieve both class, as well as enum symbol names, will break.

If so desired, this can be worked around as follows in a cross-version compatible manner to maintain the old behaviour:
<code php>
$classes = get_declared_classes();
if (function_exists('get_declared_enums')) {
    $enums   = get_declared_enums();
    $classes = array_values(array_unique(array_merge($classes, $enums)));
}
</code>

Alternatively, the new (PHP 9.0) behaviour could be emulated in a cross-version compatible manner, like so:
<code php>
$classes = get_declared_classes();
$enums   = [];
if (function_exists('get_declared_enums')) {
    $enums = get_declared_enums();
}

if (PHP_VERSION_ID < 90000) {
    if (!empty($enums)) {
        // PHP 8.5 < 9.0: only remove enums from $classes.
        $classes = array_diff($classes, $enums);
    } elseif (function_exists('enum_exists')) {
        // PHP 8.1 - 8.4: remove enums from $classes and add to $enums.
        $classes = array_values(array_filter(
            $classes,
            function ($name) use (&$enums) {
                if (enum_exists($name, false)) {
                    $enums[] = $name;
                    return false;
                }

                return true;
            }
        ));
    }
}
</code>

Tools like [[https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility|PHPCompatibility]], [[http://phpstan.org/|PHPStan]] and [[http://exakat.io/|Exakat]], could possibly/probably flag up code which would potentially be affected by the PHP 9.0 removal of enums from the return value of <php>get_declared_classes()</php>.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

  * Next PHP 8.x for introducing the ''get_declared_enums()'' function.
  * Next PHP 8.x for deprecating the use of <php>class_exists()</php> on enum symbols.
  * PHP 9.0 for the change to the return value of <php>get_declared_classes()</php> (to not include enums).
  * PHP 9.0 for the change to the return value of <php>class_exists()</php> (to return ''false'' for enums instead of ''true'').

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None

==== To Existing Extensions ====

None

==== To Opcache ====

None

==== New Constants ====

None

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None


===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

The behaviour of the <php>get_declared_interfaces()</php> and <php>get_declared_traits()</php> functions remains unchanged.\\
The behaviour of the <php>interface_exists()</php>, <php>trait_exists()</php> and <php>enum_exists()</php> functions remains unchanged.

The Reflection API for enums also remains unchanged.

===== Future Scope =====

  * The pre-RFC discussion yielded some interesting ideas regarding potentially new functionality to retrieve the symbols loaded by a specific file ''include''/''require''. These are not addressed in this RFC and are left as a potential future language enhancement.
  * The pre-RFC discussion also highlighted that the ''get_declared_*()'' functions are not terribly memory efficient. Cutting down on memory fragmentation/garbage collector churn caused by these functions is outside the scope of the current proposal.


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Each vote would need a 2/3 majority. Voting started on 2024-XX-XX
YY:YY UTC and closed on 2024-XX-XX YY:YY UTC.
