  * Version: 1.0

  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unserialize_warn_on_trailing_data

===== Introduction =====

tbd

===== Proposal =====

tbd

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

A new warning will be emitted when the input to <php>unserialize()</php> contains unconsumed bytes after successfully unserializing something. For users that use a throwing error handler this will result in <php>unserialize()</php> failing, other users might just see the new warning or not notice anything at all, of they suppress warnings (e.g. by calling <php>@unserialize()</php>).

This new warning is the purpose of the RFC, thus the justification is the description above.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x (8.3).

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

The same impact as with userland code.

==== To Opcache ====

None.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Anything that isn't <php>unserialize()</php> or more generally related to serialization.

===== Future Scope =====

  * Make this an error.
