====== PHP RFC: Make unserialize() emit a warning for trailing data ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2022-10-31
  * Author: Tim Düsterhus, timwolla@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unserialize_warn_on_trailing_data

===== Introduction =====

PHP silently accepts trailing data after a valid serialization payload when unserializing. This is undesirable.

Once PHP’s unserialization parser finds the trailing delimiter of the serialized value ('';'' for scalars and ''}'' for arrays and objects), parsing terminates, the serialized value is returned, and any additional input bytes are silently ignored.

As <php>serialize</php> returns a valid serialization payload without trailing data, having trailing data within the input to <php>unserialize</php> implies that the serialization data was erroneously modified after-the-fact. Silently accepting such serialization data therefore is likely to mask (serious) issues within the application’s handling of (serialized) data and therefore undesirable.



===== Proposal =====

<php>unserialize()</php> shall emit a new E_WARNING whenever the input string contains additional bytes once the unserialization parser terminates after successfully parsing a value. In other words: A warning shall be emitted if bytes can be removed from the end of the input string without changing the return value of <php>unserialize()</php> .

==== Examples ====

<PHP>
<?php

var_dump(unserialize('i:5;i:6;'));
// Warning: unserialize(): Extra data starting at offset 4 of 8 bytes in %s on line %d
// int(5)

var_dump(unserialize('N;i:6;'));
// Warning: unserialize(): Extra data starting at offset 2 of 6 bytes in %s on line %d
// NULL

var_dump(unserialize('b:1;i:6;'));
// Warning: unserialize(): Extra data starting at offset 4 of 8 bytes in %s on line %d
// bool(true)

var_dump(unserialize('a:1:{s:3:"foo";b:1;}i:6;'));
// Warning: unserialize(): Extra data starting at offset 20 of 24 bytes in %s on line %d
// array(1) {
//   ["foo"]=>
//   bool(true)
// }
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

A new warning will be emitted when the input to <php>unserialize()</php> contains unconsumed bytes after successfully unserializing something.

For users that use a throwing error handler, this will result in <php>unserialize()</php> failing for this type of modified input string. The documentation already states that passing strings that were not created by <php>serialize()</php> must not be passed to <php>unserialize()</php>, because doing so might introduce security issues.

Users that do not use a throwing error handler might just see the new warning.

Users might not notice anything at all if they suppress unserialize warnings (e.g. by calling <php>@unserialize()</php>).

The new warning is the entire purpose of this RFC, thus the justification for the possible breaks is the reasoning given before.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x (8.3).
