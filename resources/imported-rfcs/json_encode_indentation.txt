====== PHP RFC: json_encode indentation ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2021-06-03
  * Author: Timon de Groot, tdegroot96@gmail.com
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7093
  * Status: Voting

===== Introduction =====
Programs can serialize data to JSON using the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php|json_encode]] function. The function is widely used for generating JSON responses or payload over HTTP. Currently, it's not possible to tell json_encode what indentation level (2 spaces, 4 spaces, etc.) should be used when using the //JSON_PRETTY_PRINT// option. When generating JSON files which can be used/read/edited by users, indentation starts to become a relevant topic.

===== Proposal =====
Introducing a 4th parameter, called //indent//. The type of the parameter is int and its default value is 4.

By default, an indentation of 4 spaces will be applied, just like the original //json_encode// behaviour with the //JSON_PRETTY_PRINT// option. 

When the //indent// parameter is passed a different value, an indentation of N spaces will be applied.

<code php>
$data = [
    'key' => 4,
    'other_key' => [2]
];

echo json_encode(['behavior' => 'default'], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT) . PHP_EOL;
echo json_encode($data, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT, 512, 2) . PHP_EOL;

?>
</code>

<code json>
{
    "behavior": "default"
}
{
  "key": 4,
  "other_key": [
    2
  ]
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The only breaking change this could cause is when programs are already passing a fourth parameter by accident.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
  * next PHP 8.x

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Normal usage (as opposed to what is described in BIC) of the json_encode function will not be affected, as the default of 4 spaces will still be in effect.

===== Patches and Tests =====
Tests are written with the RFC
