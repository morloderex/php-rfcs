===== Introduction =====

PHP offers facilities for large number and decimal arithmetic (GMP and BCMath), but currently using those is a PITA. This RFC proposes to improve the situation by adding support for *operator overloading in internal classes*. Furthermore this RFC exemplarily implements the new API for GMP (and improves GMP in various ways along the way).
