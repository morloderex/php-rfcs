===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to add support for final anonymous classes. 

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to add support for final anonymous classes. 

This should also allow some additional opcache optimizations, such as any JIT logic gated behind a check on ZEND_ACC_FINAL, i.e. https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/opcache/jit/zend_jit_trace.c#L4507.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.4

===== RFC Impact =====

See Backward Incompatible Changes.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

2/3 required to accept.

===== Rejected Features =====

Personally, I would have instead preferred the much cleaner approach of making all anonymous classes final by default, (preferrably) without offering the option to make them non-final.

However, I understand that this might be a little bit too restrictive for something that may have some valid usecases, even if extending anonymous classes currently requires some hack-ish workarounds with class_alias.

Thus, this RFC initially included three mutually exclusive proposals:

  - Add support for final anonymous classes (''new final class {}'' syntax, no breaking changes)
  - //OR// Make all anonymous classes final by default, without the option to make them final (breaking change)
  - //OR// Make all anonymous classes final by default, provide an optional ''open'' keyword to make them non-final (like in Kotlin, ''new open class {}'', breaking changes).

As an extra proposal related to the last two options, possibly requiring a separate RFC, in the last two cases, it might be a good idea to also disallow the use of ''class_alias'' altogether for final anonymous classes (suggested by nikolas-grekas in https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11126#issuecomment-1522042841).
