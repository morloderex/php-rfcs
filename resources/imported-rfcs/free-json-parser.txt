===== Introduction =====

Since PHP 5.2.0, JSON format support is provided by ext/json.
During a code license review, Debian project have discovered a issue with the code used, reported as [[https://bugs.php.net/63520 bug #65320]].

Effectively, code from json.org is not free, as its License includes a restriction to freedom 0 (run the program for any purpose) : "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil". 

The discussion about this state is out of the scope of this RFC.

The encoder code is free since PHP 5.4.10 ([[https://bugs.php.net/id=63588 Bug #63588]])

  * Same encoder than PHP 5.5
  * Parser provided by the [[json-c]] library (License MIT)
