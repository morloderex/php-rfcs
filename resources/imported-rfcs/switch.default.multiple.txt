====== PHP RFC: Make defining multiple default cases in a switch a syntax error ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2014-08-05
  * Author: Levi Morrison <levim@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

[[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=67757|Bug 67757]] notes that the recently introduced PHP language specification differs from PHP's behavior when a switch statement defines multiple default cases.  The spec claims the following is a syntax error, while PHP will execute it just fine (resulting in the latter default block being taken).

  switch ($expr) {
    default:
      neverExecuted();
      break;
    default:
      executed();
  }

===== Proposal =====

This issue can be fixed by altering the spec to match PHP's behavior, or fixing PHP to treat multiple defaults as an error. This RFC opts for the latter; it also provides a deprecation route.

PHP 5.7: Raise ''E_DEPRECATED'' each time a default blocks after the first is encountered; continue to execute only the last default block. \\
PHP 7.0: Raise ''E_COMPILE_ERROR'' when multiple default blocks are found.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

There may be code out there (maybe generated code?) which relies on being able to define multiple default blocks and having only the last block executed. This RFC takes the position that multiple default blocks was an implementation detail that should not have been relied upon.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This RFC targets both PHP 5.7 and 7.0.
