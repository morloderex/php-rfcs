====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-01-02 
  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

The PHP OpenSSL extension has functions for data encryption (openssl_encrypt) and decryption (openssl_decrypt). These function works fine for all cipher algorithms (cipher + mode) except ciphers with AEAD (Authenticated Encrypt with Associated Data). These modes requires special handling in OpenSSL and a need for supplying or retrieving the authenticated tag and optionally AAD (associated application data)

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes adding extra parameters to openssl_encrypt and openssl_decrypt for accessing authenticated tag and data.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

none

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
none

==== To Existing Extensions ====
none

==== To Opcache ====
none

==== New Constants ====
none

===== Open Issues =====
Default tag length and parameters order.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

The current encryption and decryption is unaffected. The new parameters are optional.

===== Future Scope =====

Adding support for OCB mode once the extension supports OpenSSL 1.1

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
50%+1 majority
