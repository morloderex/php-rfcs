===== Introduction =====

PHP 8.0 added parameter and return type declarations for the vast majority of internal functions and methods ([[https://github.com/php/php-src/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3AStubs+is%3Aclosed|Stubs initiative]]) because the different variance-related RFCs, as well as the  [[rfc:consistent_type_errors|PHP RFC: Consistent type errors for internal functions]], the [[rfc:union_types_v2|PHP RFC: Union Types 2.0]], and the [[rfc:mixed_type_v2|PHP RFC: Mixed Type v2]] RFCs made it possible to cover nearly any cases. However, there are a few reasons why type information can be still missing:
  * **When a type includes resources:** it's not possible to declare types containing resources as there is no ''resource'' type declaration. However, resources are currently being phased out ([[https://github.com/php/php-tasks/issues/6|Resource to object migration]]), so there are less and less of such type declarations each day.
  * **When a function or method doesn't parse parameters according to the general rules:** This can be the case when e.g. an internal function or method doesn't respect the strict_types mode. PHP 8.0 fixed lots of such issues, but around 250 parameters are still not parsed correctly, due to various reasons. These could be fixed individually in the future.
  * **For ''out'' pass-by-ref parameters**: the type of these parameters is not validated during ZPP, thus it would be incorrect to declare any type for the parameters in question. An in/out parameter RFC would be a prerequisite in order to do so.
  * **For the return type of non-final methods**: According to the covariance rules, adding return types to overridden methods constitutes as a BC break, since the overriding method's signature becomes incompatible. As all non-final internal methods are possibly overridden, the PHP project leaders decided not to cause such a big BC break just yet.

The current RFC aims to solve the last problem by providing a longer term, gradual migration path for users to update their codebases with the necessary method return types.

===== Proposal =====

Internal method return types are declared tentatively in PHP 8.1, and they will become enforced in PHP 9.0. It means that in PHP 8.x versions, a "strict standards" notice is raised during inheritance checks when an internal method is overridden in a way that the return types are incompatible, and PHP 9.0 will makes these a fatal error. A few examples:

The overriding method doesn't declare any return type (PHP 8.1):

<code php>
class MyDateTime extends DateTime
{
    public function modify(string $modifier) { return false; }
}

// Strict standards: Declaration of MyDateTime::modify(string $modifier) should be
// compatible with DateTime::modify(string $modifier): DateTime|false
</code>

The overriding method doesn't declare any return type (PHP 9.0):

<code php>
class MyDateTime extends DateTime
{
    public function modify(string $modifier) { return false; }
}

// Fatal error: Declaration of MyDateTime::modify(string $modifier) must be
// compatible with DateTime::modify(string $modifier): DateTime|false
</code>

The overriding method declares a wrong return type (PHP 8.1):

<code php>
class MyDateTime extends DateTime
{
    public function modify(string $modifier): ?DateTime { return null; }
}

// Strict standards: Declaration of MyDateTime::modify(string $modifier): ?DateTime should be
// compatible with DateTime::modify(string $modifier): DateTime|false
</code>

The overriding method declares a wrong return type (PHP 9.0):

<code php>
class MyDateTime extends DateTime
{
    public function modify(string $modifier): ?DateTime { return null; }
}

// Fatal error: Declaration of MyDateTime::modify(string $modifier): ?DateTime must be
// compatible with DateTime::modify(string $modifier): DateTime|false
</code>

The rationale behind resurrecting a currently extinct error category (''E_STRICT'') for the notices about future return type changes is to allow users the freedom to handle these problems separately from deprecations and other issues, like warnings.

Unfortunately, union return types impose a compatibility challenge for libraries: as this construct is only supported since PHP 8.0, libraries would have to accept the fact that their code triggers E_STRICT notices on PHP 8.1 if they also want to support PHP versions below 8.0. As a remedy, this RFC proposes to add a ''SuppressReturnTypeNotice'' attribute which could be used to suppress the notice. Thanks to the backward compatible syntax of attributes, this can be done in code which is compatible with older PHP versions.

<code php>
class MyDateTime extends DateTime
{
    /**
     * @return DateTime|false
     */
    #[SuppressReturnTypeNotice]
    public function modify(string $modifier) { return false; }
}

// No notice is triggered 
</code>

====== Reflection ======

Two new methods are proposed for addition to the ''ReflectionMethod'' class in order to provide reflection information about tentative return types:

<code php>
class ReflectionMethod
{
    public function hasTentativeReturnType(): bool {}
    public function getTentativeReturnType(): ?ReflectionType {}
}
</code>

As tentative return types are considered similarly as PHPDoc return type hints, ''ReflectionMethod::hasReturnType()'' and ''ReflectionMethod::getReturnType()'' returns ''false'' and ''null'', respectively, when a method has a tentative return type.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

In PHP 8.1, an E_STRICT notice would be raised for each method which has an incompatible return type with its overridden internal method. In PHP 9.0, incompatible return types would always trigger a fatal error.


===== Future Scope =====

Tentative return types could be extended to user-land methods by using a ''TentativeReturnType'' attribute. This would be useful for libraries that want to add return types gradually.

===== Vote =====

Add return type declarations for internal methods? The vote requires 2/3 majority to be accepted.
