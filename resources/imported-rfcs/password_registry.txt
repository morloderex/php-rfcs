===== Introduction =====
The **password_*()** functions introduced a means to support standardized password hashing mechanisms for use by applications. Support for bcrypt was included in the initial launch, with argon2i and argon2id being added later (if and only if libargon was available on the system at the time of compilation.

This qualification about the availability of libargon is a complicating factor for linux distributions where the core of php-src is often kept intentionally lean, with additional extensions being provided in separate packages to be loaded only by those installations who want the additional functionality.  This means that some percentage of distro package users either have a library dependency they didn't want, or lack functionality they did want.

This proposal seeks to remedy this by introducing a password hashing registry mechanism similar to the Hash extension's php_hash_register_algo() API.

===== Proposal =====

====== Internal API ======

    struct php_password_algo {
      const char* name; // Symbolic name of the algorithm, e.g. "argon2id"
      zend_string* (*hash)(const zend_string* password, zend_array* options);
      zend_bool (*verify)(const zend_string* password, const zend_string* hash);
      zend_bool (*needs_rehash)(const zend_string* hash);
      zend_bool (*valid)(const zend_string* hash);
    };

    PHPAPI zend_long php_password_algo_register(php_password_algo* algo);
    PHPAPI php_password_algo* php_password_algo_find(zend_long algo_id);
    PHPAPI zend_long php_password_algo_identify(const zend_string* hash);
    PHPAPI void php_password_algo_unregister(zend_long algo_id);
    
Extensions wishing to provide an algorithm implementation will setup a (typically global const) structure to contain the four method pointers and call **php_password_algo_register()** during MINIT to hook in.  The integer value returned by this function will be a process unique integer value which the extension may assign to a constant or leave to discovery via //password_algos()//.

The **hash**, **verify**, and **needs_rehash** method pointers function exactly as their PHP userspace functions describe, but don't require an algo ID, as this has already been determined by the exported functions in looking up the algorithm.

The **valid** method pointer is the mechanism used for determining what algorithm handler is appropriate for a given hash string.  For example, only the **bcrypt** handler should return true for a hash string beginning with "$2y$".

In order to fail-closed, if more than one algorithm returns true for **valid()**, then ALL implementations must pass their corresponding verify() test in order for the password to be considered valid.  This is considered an undesirable use-case, and implementations attempting to hijack a password hashing mechanism must explicitly make the decision to disable the previous handler in order to override behavior.

====== Userspace API ======

An additional function, password_algos(), will be added to return a complete list of all registered password hashing algorithms as a numerically indexed array.  The key of this array will be the process-unique algorithm identifier, while the value element will be the human readable name for the algo.  For example:

    > print_r(password_algos());
    Array (
        [1] => "bcrypt"
        [2] => "argon2i"
        [3] => "argon2id"
    )

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Algorithm numeric identifiers are no longer fixed values which can't change between installations.  Applications MUST use the constant or symbolic name when specifying algorithms rather than hard code the numeric value for the algo.

===== Extension Changes =====
ext/standard will continue to register the bcrypt algo, as well as argon2i and argon2i if the library is available at compile time in order to maintain compatibility with older builds.  The ext/sodium extension will be extended to make "standard" an explicit dependency, then will check to see if argon2i/argon2id were registered already.  If not, they will be registered by ext/sodium to produce compatible results available via dynamic load.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.next

===== Open Questions =====
  * Should the registry support password hashing mechanisms defined in script code? (I don't think so, but feel free to disagree)

===== Future Scope =====
Review ext/sodium to see if there are additional password hashing algorithms it may be appropriate to enable.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Simple 50% +1, make the password hashing system extensible via internal-only registry.

===== Patches and Tests =====
To be written.

===== Implementation =====
To be written.
