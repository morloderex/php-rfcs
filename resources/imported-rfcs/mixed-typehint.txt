====== PHP RFC: Mixed typehint ======
  * Version: 1.0

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
With the addition of scalar types in PHP 7, nullables in 7.1 and recently object in 7.2, it's now possible to explicitly declare accepted types for most of the parameters and return types. Unfortunately without mixed type it's still not possible to achieve a fully type hinted and consistent code using simple types.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to add the ''mixed'' type to be used for parameter and return types to explicitly declare desired type, instead of being forced to not declare anything.

Primary motivation for having explicit mixed type is consistence and easier static analysis.
In PHP 7.2, mixed types are unfortunately the only type that could not be type hinted upon (and resource as well, but its future is unclear). Having mixed type would allow a code with 100% type coverage in most cases.

The behavior of the ''mixed'' type fully matches the behavior when nothing is specified for parameter or return type (thus being implicitly mixed), effectively being an alias for previous behavior.

===== Nullability =====
As the ''mixed'' type accepts //anything//, including null, nullable mixed type (''?mixed'') is disabled at compile time.

<code php>
function foo(): ?mixed {}
// Fatal error
</code>

===== Variance =====

No changes to variance needed. Exactly same rules as when no type is present apply.

Since the ''mixed'' type and no type are functionally equivalent, the following code is functionally equivalent as well:
<code php>
function foo($arg) {
    return $arg;
}
</code>
and
<code php>
function foo(mixed $arg): mixed {
    return $arg;
}
</code>

Same applies to inheritance, where mixed type and no type could be interchanged without any error. This code would work just fine:
<code php>
class Foo {
    public function test(mixed $arg): mixed {
        return $arg;
     }
}
class Bar extends Foo {
    public function test($arg) {
        return parent::test($arg);
    }
}
class Baz extends bar {
    public function test(mixed $arg): mixed {
        return parent::test($arg);
    }
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None, ''mixed'' is already reserved word since PHP 7.0.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.3

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None.

==== To Opcache ====
Not analyzed.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
No changes to type cast operators.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Simple yes/no vote to either accept or reject addition of mixed type.
As this is a language change, 2/3 majority is required.
