===== Introduction =====

_php_math_basetozval(), which underlies the base_convert(), bindec(), octdec(), and hexdec() userspace functions, uses a custom parsing loop which ignores any characters in the input string which aren't in the [0-9a-zA-Z] set.  This results in input strings containing garbage being quietly processed as though they were valid numeric strings, for example:

  base_convert(1.5, 10, 10); -> 15
  base_convert("&%^&%^#%#^%4#%#(%*!2#(%*", 10, 10); -> 42

Equally confusing, ordinals greater or equal to the base being converted are also ignored:

  base_convert("12304560", 2, 10); -> 4

===== Proposal =====

One of the following solutions:

  * A. Throw a Warning (or Notice) when unexpected characters are encountered, but continue as before
  * B. Throw a Warning and return FALSE on unexpected characters
  * C. Throw a Warning, stop processing, and return the value up to that point (strtol() behavior)

Option A is the least BC breaking option of these three, and may be desirable for 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 branches while master takes a more aggressive option.
