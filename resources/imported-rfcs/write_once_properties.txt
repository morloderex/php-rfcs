====== PHP RFC: Write-Once Properties ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2020-02-18
  * Author: Máté Kocsis, <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Status: In Discussion
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5186

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes to add support for a new property modifier that would allow properties to be initialized, but not modified afterwards. This feature would be useful in situations where one wants to guarantee that a property remains the same for the lifetime of an object - which is usually the case for Value Objects or Data Transfer Objects. Other languages, like Java and C# also have similar - but not exactly the same - concepts for a long time (''final'' and ''readonly'' respectively).

===== Proposal =====
"Write-once" properties in PHP (the actual keyword is to be decided) could be initialized either by an explicit default value, or by an assignment operation. Unlike to ''final'' properties in Java, this RFC proposes to allow the initialization of object properties after object construction. The main purpose of choosing this approach is to make lazy loading possible - which is an important aspect for many PHP applications. In addition to object properties, class properties can also use the modifier in question with the same rules.

As soon as initialization is done, any other attempt to assign a value to "write-once" properties results in an exception. Besides assignment, the increment, decrement, and unset operations are also forbidden. As arrays are an immutable data structure in PHP, any attempt to mutate a property of array type (adding/removing/changing items) is forbidden. However, properties of object or resource types still remain mutable internally (see example below). In order to avoid problems with references, references on "write-once" properties are disabled as well.

<code php>

class Foo
{
    <keyword> public int $a = 1;
    <keyword> public string $b;
    <keyword> public array $c = ["foo"];
    <keyword> public object $d;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->b = "foo";
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();

$foo->a = 2;		// EXCEPTION: property a has already been initialized
$foo->b = "bar";	// EXCEPTION: property b has already been initialized
$foo->a++;		// EXCEPTION: incrementing/decrementing is forbidden
unset($foo->c);		// EXCEPTION: unsetting is forbidden
$foo->c[] = "bar";	// EXCEPTION: array values can't be modified
next($foo->c);		// EXCEPTION: internal pointer of arrays can't be modified as well
$var= &$this->c;	// EXCEPTION: reference isn't allowed

key($foo->c);		// SUCCESS: internal pointer of arrays is possible to read
$foo->d = new Foo();	// SUCCESS: property d hasn't been initialized before
$foo->d->foo = "foo";	// SUCCESS: objects are still mutable internally

</code>

As untyped properties have an implicit default value (''null'') in the absense of an explicit one, their usefulness would be very limited. In order to avoid the introduction of unintiutive workarounds, this RFC proposes to disable the property modifier in question for them. Contrarily to untyped properties, typed properties are in uninitialized state by default, so they play well with the write-once semantics.

===== Alternative Approaches =====
As there are quite a few alternatives to implement a similar feature, I would like to highlight why the current one was chosen. Please find below a short evaluation about the various possibilities that were also considered, but got rejected.

==== Read-only semantics ====
This is the implementation that Java and C# both use. It has really clear rules: a ''final'' or ''readonly'' property has to be initialized until object construction ends by assigning value to them exactly once, and no further changes are allowed afterwards. On the plus side, we can always be sure that a property has a value, but the downside is that lazy initialization is not possible anymore with this approach. Apart from the (unnecessarily) strict behaviour, another problem is that this implementation is hardly applicable in PHP where object construction is a "fuzzy" term.

==== Write-until-construction semantics ====
According to this idea, a property could be assigned to multiple times until object construction ends, and no further changes would be allowed from that point on. Even though this approach makes it easier to deal with bigger class hierarchies (in which case it's likely that multiple constructors are involved in object creation, increasing the chance of assigning to the same property multiple times), it also has the same disadvantages as the read-only approach.

===== Open Questions =====
As there is no consensus about the name of the modifier, I'd like to put it to vote. You can find below the ideas that came up during discussion along with some pros/cons:

  * ''final'': This keyword currently affects inheritance, but not mutability rules in PHP, thus the final property modifier would be confusing in this form
  * ''sealed'': This keyword affects inheritance rules in other languages (e.g. in C#), thus it is also not a good candidate for us
  * ''locked'': It's not an estabilished term in the context of objects, however probably it's too vague a name
  * ''immutable'': It's a descriptive name which sounds well, although it's also a little bit misleading since the usage of mutable data structures (objects, resources) are not restricted in any way
  * ''writeonce'': It's the most technically accurate name, however, it sounds exotic, and it might be confusing from the end-users perspective, as they are generally not expected to write these properties
  * ''readonly'':  Although it's not as technically accurate as "writeonce", it represent the feature perfectly for end-users who are expected to only read these properties. C# also uses the same term for a similar purpose.

Considering the above, "locked", "immutable", "writeonce", and "readonly" is going to be proposed as voting choices of the decision about the keyword.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There are no backward incompatible changes in this proposal except for the fact that "locked", "immutable", "writeonce", or "readonly" would become a reserved keyword depending on the outcome of the secondary vote.

===== Future Scope =====
Adding support for "write-once" properties would lay the groundwork for immutable objects - for which I'm going to create a proposal should the current RFC be accepted.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
The primary vote ("Do you want to add support for the proposed property modifier?") requires 2/3 majority, while the secondary one ("Which keyword to use"?) requires a simple majority.
