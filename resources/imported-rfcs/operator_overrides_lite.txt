===== Introduction =====

Nearly three years ago, [[rfc:user_defined_operator_overloads|PHP RFC: User Defined Operator Overloads]] was declined due to scope and new syntax concerns. However, the GMP class, which represents numbers in the GMP extension, was (accidentally) left non-final. This RFC explores the potential of extending GMP with a limited form of operator overriding, providing cleaner expressions for mathematical constructs and allowing new types of numerical representations such as units, complex numbers, and more.

===== Proposal =====

The \GMP class will have the following methods added as protected static:

  * add(mixed $left, mixed $right): static
  * subtract(mixed $left, mixed $right): static
  * multiply(mixed $left, mixed $right): static
  * divide(mixed $left, mixed $right): static
  * mod(mixed $left, mixed $right): static
  * exp(mixed $left, mixed $right): static
  * comparable(mixed $left, mixed right): bool

These methods will enable operator-like behavior when extended. Overriding equals, less-than, greater-than, etc., is not included to maintain simplicity and avoid non-sensical comparisons.

Binary operations will be handled as such:

  - If both operands are instances of `\GMP`, standard behavior applies.
  - If one operand is a subclass of `\GMP`, the subclass's method is invoked.
  - If both operands are subclasses, only the left operand's method is called. Compatibility checks are the subclass's responsibility.

Here's a basic implementation example for duration represented in seconds:

<code php>
  class Duration extends \GMP {
    public function __construct(int|\GMP|float $time) {
        parent::__construct($time, 10);
    }

    private static function assertCompatible($arg): void {
        if ($arg instanceof self || is_numeric($arg) || (is_object($arg) && get_class($arg) === '\GMP')) {
            return;
        }
        throw new LogicException('Duration is not compatible with ' . gettype($arg));
    }

    private static function assertNumber($arg): void {
        if (is_numeric($arg) || (is_object($arg) && get_class($arg) === '\GMP')) {
            return;
        }
        throw new LogicException('Argument is not a number: ' . gettype($arg));
    }

    protected static function add(mixed $left, mixed $right): static {
        self::assertCompatible($right);
        return new self(parent::add($left, $right));
    }

    protected static function subtract(mixed $left, mixed $right): static {
        self::assertCompatible($right);
        return new self(parent::subtract($left, $right));
    }

    protected static function multiply(mixed $left, mixed $right): static {
        if ($left instanceof self) self::assertNumber($right);
        if ($right instanceof self) self::assertNumber($left);
        return new self(parent::multiply($left, $right));
    }

    protected static function divide(mixed $left, mixed $right): static {
        self::assertNumber($right);
        return new self(parent::divide($left, $right));
    }

    protected static function mod(mixed $left, mixed $right): static {
        throw new LogicException('Not implemented');
    }

    protected static function exp(mixed $left, mixed $right): static {
        throw new LogicException('Not implemented');
    }

    protected static function comparable(mixed $left, mixed $right): bool {
        return $left instanceof self && $right instanceof self;
    }

    public function asMinutes(): float {
        return $this / 60;
    }
  
    /* and so on */
  }
</code>

This approach provides valuable semantics and type safety, especially in contexts like attributes and properties:

<code php>
define('SECOND', new Duration(1));

// Use in attributes
#[Delay(5 * SECOND)]

// Use in properties
public Duration $delay = 5 * SECOND;
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

There are no backward incompatible changes. Existing GMP-based code will remain unaffected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

8.4 if time allows, or the next version.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No impact.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Only GMP will be affected.

==== To Opcache ====

There should be no impact to Opcache.

===== Open Issues =====
None, yet.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Code using the GMP extension without extending it will remain unchanged.

===== Future Scope =====

  * support for other operators
  * serialization/unserialization

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * Allow extending the \GMP class and use a form of operator overloading
  * Disallow extending the \GMP class

A "NO" vote implies making the `\GMP` class final to prevent further extensions.

===== Patches and Tests =====

A prototype patch will be provided before voting.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
