  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2018-02-13
  * Author: Pieter Hordijk, peehaa@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/default-session-strict-mode

===== Introduction =====
Changing default setting of distributed .ini's to use strict mode sessions by default.

===== Proposal =====
Currently strict mode for session is disabled by default in our distributed ini files (php.ini-development and php.ini-production). However it is recommended to enable it to prevent session fixation issues.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 7.x" or "next PHP 7.x.y".

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None?

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
None

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
N/A

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Simple yes/no vote. Yes means changing the default mode in the ini files, no means leave it as it is.

State whether this project requires a 2/3 or 50%+1 majority (see [[voting]])

===== Patches and Tests =====
No patch supplied yet as it is a trivial change in the ini files.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
