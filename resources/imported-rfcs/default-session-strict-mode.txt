====== PHP RFC: Session strict mode default ini settings ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2018-02-13
  * Author: Pieter Hordijk, peehaa@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/default-session-strict-mode

===== Introduction =====
Changing default setting ''session.use_strict_mode'' of distributed .ini's to use strict mode sessions by default preventing session fixation by session adoption.

===== Proposal =====
Currently strict mode for sessions is disabled by default. Both our distributed ini files (php.ini-development and php.ini-production) disable strict mode. However it is recommended to enable it to prevent session fixation issues.

In by far the most cases you want to enable strict mode for sessions. As such this proposal enables a sane default for almost all of our users. 

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This proposal only changes a default in the distributed ini files and doesn't remove any functionality.
The only possible BC break would be if somebody downloads a new PHP version (including ini files) //and// happens to be among the very few users who needs adoptive sessions //and// doesn't change the session directive.

As such the possible BC impact is almost non-existent.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.next

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
None

==== php.ini Defaults ====
In both php.ini-development and php.ini-production ''session.use_strict_mode'' will be enabled:

<code>session.use_strict_mode = 0</code>

===== Open Issues =====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
N/A

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Simple yes/no vote. Yes means changing the default mode in the ini files to enable strict sessions, no means leave it as it is.

Requires a 50%+1 majority

===== Patches and Tests =====
No patch supplied yet as it is a trivial change in the ini files.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
