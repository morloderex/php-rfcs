====== PHP RFC: is_json ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2022-08-14
  * Author: Juan Carlos Morales, dev.juan.morales@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/is_json

===== Preliminary note =====

**If the name of the function needs to be change, I will change it; the functionality is the important thing here**

===== Introduction =====
This RFC introduces a new function called is_json() to validate if an string contains a valid json.

Most userland implementations to achieve this are done using json_decode() which by design generates an object/array while parsing the string, ergo using memory and processing, that could be save.

===== Proposal =====
==== Description ====
<code php>
is_json(string $json, int $depth = 512, int $flags = 0): bool
</code>

==== Parameters ====
**''json''**

The json string being analyzed.

This function only works with UTF-8 encoded strings.

Note:

PHP implements a superset of JSON as specified in the original » RFC 7159.

**''depth''**

Maximum nesting depth of the structure being decoded.

**''flags''**

Bitmask of **JSON_INVALID_UTF8_IGNORE**, **JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR**. The behavior of these constants is described on the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/json.constants.php|JSON constants page]].

Function description, examples, technical strategy, current JSON parser, etc.

==== Return values ====

Returns **true** if the string passed contains a valid json, otherwise returns **false**.

==== Extra behavior ====

==== Examples ====

===== Fundaments/Reasons =====
==== Disadvantages of using json_decode ====

By design, json_decode() generates an object/array while parsing the string, ergo using memory and processing for it, that is not needed if the only thing to discover is if a string contains a valid json.

==== Disadvantages of using regex ====

Using a regex for this task forces different, error-prone, hard to maintain, implementations.

==== Needs from major projects and developers ====

In the "References" section, there is a list of major open-source php projects needing this feature; also in th mntioned section can find a link to one of the most popular StackOverflow questions, which somehow reflects the need from our developers to have a feature like this included.

==== Complexity added in the core ====

At the moment, there is a JSON parser in the core, used by json_decode to do its job, so there is no need to write a new JSON parser for this RFC; the proposed function will use the existing JSON parser exclusively to parse an string without generating any object/array in memory for it.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None, as this is a new function only.

**is_json** will no longer be available as a function name, could break potential userland implementations.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
next PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
This RFC has no impact on SAPIs, existing extensions, Opcache, etc.

===== Open Issues =====
- No open issues

===== Future Scope =====
- (To be defined)

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
- (To be defined)

===== Implementation =====
- (To be done later after pushing to github)
