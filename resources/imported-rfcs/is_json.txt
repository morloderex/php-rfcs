===== Introduction =====
This RFC introduces a new function called is_json() to validate if an string is a valid json-string.

===== Fundaments =====
- Disadvantages of using json_decode or other regex approach.
- Reasons for this and projects emulating this with json_decode.
- Use existing JSON parser in a more isolated way.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes a new function, that returns true if the given string is a valid json-string.

Function description, examples, technical strategy, current JSON parser, etc.

**is_json** will no longer be available as a function name, could break potential userland implementations.

next PHP 8.x
