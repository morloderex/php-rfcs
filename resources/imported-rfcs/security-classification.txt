At the end of last month, Stas posted to internals with some ideas to reform security issue [[http://externals.io/thread/415|classification]], and [[http://externals.io/thread/414|handling]].

Before we can seek to implement changes in the process, we should seek ratification of the [[:security|classification]].

==== Voting ====

Voting opened November 10th for one week, closing November 17th:

<doodle title="Officially adopt the proposed security issue classification scheme ?" auth="krakjoe" voteType="single" closed="false">
   * Yes
   * No
</doodle>


**There is no change to the language, however, since this is an important issue, we are going to require a super majority of 2/3+1.**

//Should the proposal fail to get the required votes, the classification will be reviewed and reformed before the vote is opened again: Consider this notice that there may not be two weeks between the first and subsequent vote.//
