===== Introduction =====

Currently ''Exception::$code'', ''Error::$code'' and ''Throwable::getCode()'' are only allowed to be ''int'', but this is limiting and in fact it is even violated by PHP itself, specifically by the PDO extension (whose error codes are actually strings).

===== Proposal =====

Allow any type to be used, including objects, even if just formally, because they technically already allow other types to be used, as shown in the following example. Specifically, the following members are proposed to be modified:

- Throwable::getCode(): mixed;
- Error    ::__construct(string $message = "", /* mixed */ $code = 0, Throwable $previous = null);
- Exception::__construct(string $message = "", /* mixed */ $code = 0, Throwable $previous = null);
- Error    ::$code : mixed;
- Exception::$code : mixed;

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next minor version, currently 7.2.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

===== Future Scope =====

===== Patches and Tests =====
