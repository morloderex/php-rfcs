===== Introduction =====

The PHP 8.4 development cycle has seen two major improvements to the ext-dom extension already: [[rfc::domdocument_html5_parser|HTML 5 support]], and [[rfc:opt_in_dom_spec_compliance|opt-in spec compliance]]. This RFC is (probably) the final improvement to ext-dom for PHP 8.4: it proposes to add new features to the extension. In particular, we'll be focussing on CSS selector support, filling in missing features, and adding new properties.

===== Proposal =====

The RFC consists of multiple sub-proposals bundled together under one RFC to minimize overhead.
In this section, we'll discuss each feature separately.

==== CSS selectors ====

There exist multiple ways to query nodes in an XML or HTML document. The one that's already implemented since the existence of the DOM extension is using XPath. Another popular way, that people are likely more familiar with, is CSS selectors. In theory, every query you can write with CSS selectors can be written with XPath. However, XPath is much more cumbersome to use in a lot of cases. For example, a simple query like ''p:contains("hello") + span'' is equivalent to ''./​/p[contains(normalize-space(),"hello")]/following-sibling::*[1]/self::span''. Things can get much more complicated when you use pseudo-functions like '':disabled'' which are a real pain to express in XPath.

The DOM spec defines the following CSS selector functions:
<PHP>
namespace Dom {
  interface ParentNode {
    public function querySelector(string $selectors): ?Element {}
    public function querySelectorAll(string $selectors): NodeList {}
  }

  class Element {
    // Note: this class implements the ParentNode interface, so it also has the querySelector(All) methods.
    
    public function closest(string $selectors): ?Element {}
    public function matches(string $selectors): bool {}
  }
}
</PHP>

This is what the methods do:
  * querySelector: Returns the first descendant element that matches the CSS selectors
  * querySelectorAll: Returns a NodeList containing all descendant elements that match the CSS selectors
  * closest: Finds the closest ancestor of the element that matches the CSS selectors
  * matches: Returns true if the element matches the CSS selectors, false otherwise

It's worth noting that CSS selectors can contain pseudo-classes that only make sense when something is rendered on screen. Like for example '':hover'', which matches when a user hovers over an element. Because in the context of PHP this is nonsensical, a CSS selector that uses such a pseudo-class will match nothing.

While it's possible to implement ''closest'' and ''matches'' using XPath, it cannot be done performance-efficiently (as far as I know).

The underlying library we use for the HTML5 parsing also contains the CSS functionality necessary to implement these methods. Therefore, we can get the functionality relatively easily. I only had to adapt the node data structures to match PHP's data structures.

There exist workarounds in userland that implement a CSS selector to XPath translation, but based on what I've seen:
  * They will take a performance hit because translation isn't "free"
  * They don't provide an efficient way to implement ''closest'' and ''matches''
  * Because they are implemented around the old DOM classes, and the old DOM classes didn't take into account the different HTML namespaces properly, they also don't take into account the namespaces properly.

==== Element::$innerHTML ====

This is a property on the Element class defined in the DOM spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-innerhtml-property

<PHP>
namespace Dom {
  class Element {
    public string $innerHTML;
  }
}
</PHP>

Reading from this field will get the serialization of the inner content of the element, writing to it will parse a string into a subtree and replace the contents of the element with the new subtree. If the document is an HTML document, the HTML parser / serializer will be used. If the document is an XML document, the XML parser / serializer will be used. Yes, that means that inner**HTML** can set **XML** content, and this is as defined by spec. This naming oopsie is legacy baggage from the spec that stems from the fact that the Element class is shared between XML and HTML documents for interopability.

If the serialization is not well-formed for XML, then a DOMException will be thrown of type SYNTAX_ERR, as defined by the spec.

Parsing documents (or fragments) can cause hard/soft errors. The soft errors are reported via warnings, or if the internal error handling mechanism is used then the errors are stored inside an array. Unless LIBXML_NOERROR is provided, in which case those soft errors are silenced. Note that we don't have a way to provide a parsing option to the innerHTML property, and so we cannot provide a way to silence the errors cleanly.
I asked about this on the mailing list (https://externals.io/message/123224) but got no response. This probably means that people are uncertain, and so I choose to not implement the error reporting because it's easier to omit something and add it later than it is to remove something later.

==== New properties for Document ====

I propose the additional of several new properties for the Document class to make developing a bit easier:

<PHP>
namespace Dom {
  class HTMLElement extends Element {
    /* There's an opportunity to add useful HTML-spec properties here for the future. */
  }

  class Document {
    public ?HTMLElement $body;
    /** @readonly */
    public ?HTMLElement $head;
    public string $title;
  }
}
</PHP>

These additions are described in the HTML addendum for the DOM specification in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document.

The properties should be relatively self-explanatory. <php>$body</php> refers to the body element (if there is one), <php>$head</php> to the head element, and <php>$title</php> to the text inside the title element (which in turn is inside the head element). You can read about all the details using the link above, because it's a bit more complicated when SVG is involved for example, but you should be familiar with these properties from Javascript.

As you can see, this requires adding the HTMLElement class as well. This class extends the Element class. In the future we may add properties on them too but this is left out of this RFC for now.
Elements that are within the HTML namespace will now return an instance of HTMLElement instead of Element. For example, <php>$documentElement</php> is a property on the Document class of type Element. If this is an HTML element, we will get an instance of HTMLElement instead of Element. This is all as defined in the spec.

==== TokenList ====

I propose to add the TokenList class from the DOM specification to PHP (https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-domtokenlist):

<PHP>
namespace Dom {
  /**
   * @not-serializable
   * @strict-properties
   */
  final class TokenList implements \IteratorAggregate, \Countable
  {
    private function __construct() {}

    /** @readonly */
    public int $length;
    public function item(int $index): ?string {}
    public function contains(string $token): bool {}
    public function add(string ...$tokens): void {}
    public function remove(string ...$tokens): void {}
    public function toggle(string $token, ?bool $force = null): bool {}
    public function replace(string $token, string $newToken): bool {}
    public function supports(string $token): bool {}
    public string $value;

    public function count(): int {}

    public function getIterator(): \Iterator {}
  }
}
</PHP>

An instance of TokenList can be obtained via the <php>Element::$classList</php> property.
As of now, its purpose is limited to managing the class names of an element, but the class is built in a way that it represents a set of tokens.
On the surface level, it might seem trivial to manage the class names in documents, but that's not quite true. TokenList will consider the classes as a set, handle whitespace normalization, iteration, easy manipulations like toggling, ... all for you in an easy-to-use API.

==== PHP-specific additions ====

The DOM extension already implements some PHP-specific extensions to the DOM classes, like normalization and canonicalization support.
To better support some workloads, I propose the following PHP-specific additions:

<PHP>
namespace Dom {
  /**
   * @not-serializable
   * @strict-properties
   */
  final class NamespaceInfo
  {
    public readonly ?string $prefix;
    public readonly ?string $namespaceURI;
    public readonly Element $element;

    private function __construct() {}
  }
  
  class Attr {
    public function rename(?string $namespace, string $qualifiedName): void {}
  }
  
  class Element {
    public string $substitutedNodeValue;

    /** @return list<NamespaceInfo> */
    public function getInScopeNamespaces(): array {}

    /** @return list<NamespaceInfo> */
    public function getDescendantNamespaces(): array {}

    public function rename(?string $namespace, string $qualifiedName): void {}
  }
}
</PHP>

Let's go over them one by one.

=== NamespaceInfo ===

This class is the modern replacement of the <php>DOMNamespaceNode</php> class. <php>DOMNamespaceNode</php> is misdesigned in that it tries to be a Node, but it actually isn't a node because it's not in the tree. For example, in "old DOM", when using <php>getAttributeNode("xmlns")</php> it may return a <php>DOMNamespaceNode</php> for the namespace declaration even though there's not necessarily such an attribute. The other way you could obtain a <php>DOMNamespaceNode</php> instance is via XPath by using the ''namespace::*'' axis.

The reason we have the <php>DOMNamespaceNode</php> instance returned for XPath is because of some peculiar rules laid out by https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/#namespace-nodes.
In particular, the namespace axis needs to return all in-scope namespaces for an element. However that spec link //also// states:

<blockquote>Elements never share namespace nodes: if one element node is not the same node as another element node, then none of the namespace nodes of the one element node will be the same node as the namespace nodes of another element node.</blockquote>

So we can't return the attribute node corresponding to the namespace declaration (if there even is one) because we'd have to return the //same// attribute node for //different// elements. Hence, the <php>DOMNamespaceNode</php> is returned in "old DOM". However, implementing this in "new DOM" is a problem because we'd be returning something from an XPath query that //isn't// a node. This is confusing for users and also for static analysis tools.

Because these APIs are also implemented by browsers, it's worth looking at how they solve this problem and what the spec says. Turns out this is all undocumented in the spec, and browsers don't implement the namespace axis at all.

I propose to add two methods that replace the namespace axis functionality: <php>getInScopeNamespaces</php> that replaces ''./namespace::*'' and <php>getDescendantNamespaces</php> that replaces ''./​/namespace::*''. When users would try to query namespace nodes from the namespace axis in XPath, we'll throw a DOM_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR DOMException, redirecting users to use one of these two methods.

To identify a namespace we only need to know the prefix, the uri, and the element it is scoped upon. Therefore, it has these three fields. It can only be constructed by the DOM extension, not by users. No node-specific properties will be implemented in <php>NamespaceInfo</php>.

The main advantages are:
  * The guarantee that XPath queries for nodes will always return nodes
  * Better static analysis results
  * Less confusion for users

TODO: examples

=== $substitutedNodeValue ===

In "old DOM", the <php>$nodeValue</php> property performed entity substitution, which goes against the spec and can cause [[https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/8388|security issues]]. In "new DOM", <php>$nodeValue</php> does not substitute entities (as intended by spec). However, that means we can no longer substitute entities //on purpose//. This isn't the most common use-case, but is sometimes necessary when dealing with XML //that you trust//. The <php>$substitutedNodeValue</php> property will be the node's value, but with entity substitution explicitly enabled.

TODO: examples

=== rename method ===

This is only partially PHP-specific. This method did kind of exist in [[https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/|DOM Core Level 3]], but was never implemented in PHP. We propose something very similar to what once existed in spec, but slightly improved.

Sometimes it's necessary to either change a namespace prefix for an element/attribute, change an element/attribute's name, or change its namespace URI. You can //kinda// do this today by recreating the entire subtree under an element with the new name, prefix, and namespace; but this is extremely annoying and difficult to get right. This approach also won't work if you have references to the same Element instance as now one piece of code is working on a new node while other pieces of code work on the old node.
This use-case occurs when combining different documents, or fixing up documents, like for example with userland SOAP implementations.

It turns out that changing these properties is actually super easy to do internally, so it makes sense to just expose this functionality to the user.

You'll see that the rename method follows the same signature as the <php>createElementNS</php> method, and it also performs the same namespace-related sanity checks. These sanity checks ensure that the namespace-related rules are satisfied, and if they're not, the method will throw a ''NAMESPACE_ERR'' (or ''INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR'') type of <php>DOMException</php>.

<PHP>
public function createElementNS(?string $namespace, string $qualifiedName): Element {}
public function rename(?string $namespace, string $qualifiedName): void {}
</PHP>

The first argument of the rename method allows you to change the namespace URI of the element/attribute, while the second one allows you to change the qualified name. The qualified name is the combination of the prefix and local name; or just the local name if there is no prefix.
You may be wondering: "why not split this method up into multiple different methods?". The answer is that it's not possible to do: the namespace you choose has implications on what kind of qualified name are allowed. Therefore, in most cases you //have// to change these two at the same time. It is of course possible to just change one of the two while keeping the other intact, but that must happen in accordance to the namespace-related rules.

==== Allowing PHP-specific developer experience improvements ====

DOM functions like <php>Element::insertAdjacentElement(string $where, Element $element)</php> and <php>Element::insertAdjacentText(string $where, string $data)</php> have a first "where" argument. There are only four valid values for "where": "beforebegin", "afterbegin", "beforeend", "afterend". So that's actually an enum in disguise. I propose to make use of the PHP enum feature. This would prevent programming mistakes and make IDE hints much nicer, contributing to a better developer experience. Strictly speaking, this deviates from the DOM spec, but we already model the DOM classes in a way that fits PHP's OOP model. In fact, I'd propose to allow the use of enums where it makes sense in the extension for new APIs. Since the Element class didn't exist prior to the opt-in spec compliance RFC, we can change the signature without affecting users as no releases of PHP 8.4 have been made so far.

In particular, this will result in the following enum and function signatures:
<PHP>
namespace Dom {
  enum AdjacentPosition : string {
    case BeforeBegin = "beforebegin";
    case AfterBegin = "afterbegin";
    case BeforeEnd = "beforeend";
    case AfterEnd = "afterend";
  }

  class Element {
    public function insertAdjacentElement(AdjacentPosition $where, Element $element): ?Element {}
    public function insertAdjacentText(AdjacentPosition $where, string $data): void {}
  }
}
</PHP>

The <php>AdjacentPosition</php> enum is backed such that the literal values from the DOM spec can still be used by using <php>AdjacentPosition::from("beforebegin")</php> etc.

==== API amendments ====

Initially, the [[rfc:opt_in_dom_spec_compliance|DOM spec-compliance RFC]] copied the existing APIs from the old DOM classes without a deviation for most APIs. Someone reported that the <php>(DOM)Document::xinclude()</php> has weird return value behaviour. In particular, quoting from the documentation:
<blockquote>Returns the number of XIncludes in the document, -1 if some processing failed, or false if there were no substitutions. </blockquote>
This seems to be caused by an implementation mistake. The more sensical behaviour would be to return false on failure, and the number of substitutions on success. If there were no substitutions the number 0 should be returned. I propose to make this change to the new classes.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None because this RFC only affects classes added in 8.4.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.4.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Only ext-dom is affected.

===== Open Issues =====

None yet.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Everything outside ext-dom.

===== Future Scope =====

I initially planned on including the outerHTML property too. This is very feasible with all the internal DOM work that happened during the PHP 8.4 development cycle. However, given that I haven't seen demand for this, I think my time is better spent with other features. If someone really wants this in 8.4, feel free to make a PoC implementation, should be fairly doable using Lexbor and the current ext-dom internal APIs.

The <php>HTMLElement</php> class can offer some useful properties but that's left out of here because no one really asked for that feature so far, so development time is better spent elsewhere.
