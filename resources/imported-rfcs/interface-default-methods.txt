====== PHP RFC: Interface Default Methods ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2022-06-27
  * Author: Levi Morrison, levim@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/interface-default-methods


===== Introduction =====
Over time, authors sometimes want to add methods to an interface. Today, this causes large breakages to every implementor. This RFC proposes a way to reduce the scale of breakage.

Additionally, some times interfaces can implement some functionality of their interface in terms of other parts. For example, the interface ''Countable'' could implement <php>function isEmpty(): bool</php> by using <php>$this->count() == 0</php>. Today, traits are often used to accomplish this, but default interface implementation could be used instead.

===== Proposal =====

Interface methods can now provide a default implementation.

<PHP>
interface Example {
  // Today, you cannot specify an implementation, only a
  // signature.
  function method1(): void;

  // With this RFC, you can provide an implementation:
  function method2(): void {
    echo __METHOD__, "\n";
  } 
}
</PHP>

==== Default Method Resolution ====

Default methods for interfaces introduce a form of multiple inheritance. How is a method selected?

Java's resolution algorithm looks like this:
  - Class definitions always win. If a class, or a parent class, defines a concrete method, then this will always win over all possible default methods.
  - More specific interfaces take priority over less specific ones. If interfaces ''A'' and ''B'' exist and ''B'' extends ''A'', and both have a default method for the same method, then when a class implements B directly or indirectly the method from ''B'' will take precedence over the method from ''A''.
  - If the above rules fail, then the class needs to implement the method itself, possibly delegating to one of the interfaces.

This RFC proposes the same. However, rule 2 has not yet been implemented so I am unsure how feasible it is.

Here's an example of a class delegating to another method:

<PHP>
interface Interface1 {
    function method1() { echo __METHOD__ . "\n"; }
}

interface Interface2 {
    function method1() { echo __METHOD__ . "\n"; }
}

class Class1 implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    function method1() {
        Interface1::method1();
    }
}

(new Class1())->method1(); // Interface1::method1
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None, as long as you do not use the feature.

If you do use the feature:
  * Adding a default implementation to an existing interface method will not break existing code, because every existing usage has a higher priority than the default.
  * If you add a new method to an interface, there is a compatibility break. The impact of the break is limited to places where the implementor/inheritor of the interface has a method of the same name.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.NEXT.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Modules can specify an interface implementation as well.

==== To Opcache ====
Opcache should also work with this feature.

==== To the Ecosystem ====
Previously, interface methods were not allowed to have method bodies. These tools such as parsers, code analyzers, etc will need to be updated.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Future Scope =====
This feature may be used to enhance existing interfaces in PHP.

  * ''Countable'' could add <php>function isEmpty(): bool { return $this->count() == 0; }</php>.
  * ''Iterator'' could add methods like ''map'', ''filter'', and ''reduce'' which behave similarly to ''array_map'', ''array_filter'', and ''array_reduce''.

===== Voting =====
The vote will be a simple yes/no vote on whether to include the feature.

===== Patches and Tests =====

Here is a work-in-progress pull request: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11467.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
