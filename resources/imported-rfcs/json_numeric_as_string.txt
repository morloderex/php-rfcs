  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
JSON is a data format that is often used for data exchange between different platforms. These platforms can have different number representation which might lead to problems like type inconsistency or worse in loosing information (e.g. issue with double precision)

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to introduce new constants for dealing with this problem by conversion data to the string.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The code that defines JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING and/or JSON_INT_AS_STRING will be broken. However the constants are using JSON_ prefix so their usage is not reccomanded anyway.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
The proposed versions will be one of the voting options as some might consider it as not a self-contained feature.

==== New Constants ====
JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING

JSON_INT_AS_STRING

===== Open Issues =====
Better names?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This RFC is related only to JSON extension.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
50%+1 majority (see [[voting]])

===== Patches and Tests =====
The patch is really simple and will be implemented by the author of this RFC if it's accepted.
