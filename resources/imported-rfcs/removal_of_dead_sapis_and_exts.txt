  * continuity
  * isapi
  * milter  
  * phttpd
  * pi3web

 Maintained SAPIs:
  * apache2handler
  * cli
  * cgi
  * embed
  * fpm
  * litespeed
  * nsapi
  * phpdbg

 Extensions with unmaintained dependencies

  * imap

===== Research =====

==== sapi/aolserver ====

Server home: http://sourceforge.net/projects/aolserver/
Server last release: 2012
SAPI status: to be tested

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOLserver

==== sapi/apache ====

Server last release: 2010

Apache 1.x branch not developed anymore since 2010. Also it supports no security updates anymore. 

==== sapi/apache_hooks ====

Same as sapi/apache.

==== sapi/caudium ====

Sevrer home: http://caudium.net/
Server last release: 2012
SAPI status: unsupported

The official documentation of Caudium states that PHP can only run as CGI or FCGI http://www.caudium.net/space/documentation/PHP%20Setup . Running PHP as a module is not supported anymore.

==== sapi/continuity ====

No mortal remains of the corresponding server could be found on the internets.

==== sapi/isapi ====

Server home: http://www.iis.net/
SAPI status: unsupported

The ISAPI support was announced to have been dropped already in the 5.3 migration guide. http://us2.php.net/manual/en/migration53.windows.php . 

==== sapi/milter ====

Home: https://www.milter.org/
SAPI status: to be tested

Milter is not exactly a web server but an API enabling to hook into different MTAs for mail filtering. PHP scripts running under this SAPI are not dedicated to web development, but would be invoked by the corresponding MTA. In this case also, the corresponding PHP program will need to implement whichever rules. An example of another binding to Milter, just to name one, is an interface to Amavis.

==== sapi/phttpd ===

Server home: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~pen/phttpd/
Server last release: not sure, development seems to have ended around 2000
SAPI status: development incomplete

Comment from the README: THIS IS BY NO MEANS COMPLETE NOR USABLE RIGHT NOW!

\\
Things required to be done for the final decisions:
  * research the author names
  * articulate the exact state of each dead SAPI
  * articulate the exact state and availability of the corresponding server
  * if possible and makes sense, check if the SAPIs compiles, even with very ancient but latest release of the server
  * check if there are packages supported by distros
  * notify the authors about a possible removal of the corresponding SAPI, wait for their response and include it for the final decision

This RFC crosses with https://wiki.php.net/rfc/size_t_and_int64 as removal of the dead SAPIs will exlude the need of their porting.

===== Proposal =====

SAPIs to be unconditionally removed: apache, apache_hooks, caudium, continuity, isapi, phttpd

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

As the dead SAPIs are already dead, no BC breach is expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

7

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

Dead SAPI list in the description.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

None.

===== php.ini Defaults =====

php.ini will have to be checked to remove the unavailable config options, if any.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

Should an SAPI come back, the corresponding code is available in the git history.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Remove dead SAPIs: yes/no

===== Patches and Tests =====

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====

Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
