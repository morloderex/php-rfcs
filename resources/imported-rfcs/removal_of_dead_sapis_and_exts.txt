===== Introduction =====

 Currently PHP contains many SAPIs to the servers either completely unavailable or unsupported for a long time. The same can be said about several extensions which are for long deprecated or their dependency libraries are unsupported. Here's a short list:

 Dead SAPIs:
  * aolserver
  * apache
  * apache_hooks
  * caudium
  * continuity
  * isapi
  * milter  
  * phttpd
  * pi3web
  * roxen
  * thttpd
  * tux
  * webjames
  * apache2filter - not really dead, but currently broken
  * nsapi


 Extensions with unmaintained dependencies

  * imap
  * mcrypt

 Extensions not yet ported to PHP7

  *  interbase
  *  mssql
  *  oci8
  *  pdo_dblib
  *  pdo_oci
  *  sybase_ct



 Deprecated extensions handled by https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_deprecated_functionality_in_php7 (not handled by this RFC)

  * mysql
  * ereg   

This leads to the situation where the repository contains a lot of unmaintained code. The code which doesn't become any updates for years or relies on long unmaintained libraries. Besides that code being not maintained, it is also kind of security risk.

\\
==== sapi/apache2filter ====

  * Server debian supported: yes

This Apache 2.x compatible module seems to have been supported in at least PHP5. In master, it will need to be ported.

==== sapi/caudium ====

  * Sevrer home: http://caudium.net/
  * Server last release: 2012
  * Server debian supported: not completely
  * SAPI status: unsupported

The official documentation of Caudium states that PHP can only run as CGI or FCGI http://www.caudium.net/space/documentation/PHP%20Setup . Running PHP as a module is not supported anymore.

==== sapi/continuity ====

No mortal remains of the corresponding server could be found on the internets.

==== sapi/isapi ====

  * Server home: http://www.iis.net/
  * SAPI status: unsupported

The ISAPI support was announced to have been dropped already in the 5.3 migration guide. http://us2.php.net/manual/en/migration53.windows.php .

\\
==== sapi/milter ====

  * Home: https://www.milter.org/
  * Server debian supported: yes
  * SAPI status: 5.4 builds with sendmail 8.14

Milter is not a web server but an API enabling to hook into different MTAs for mail filtering. PHP scripts running under this SAPI are not dedicated to web development, but would be invoked by the corresponding MTA. In this case also, the corresponding PHP program will need to implement whichever rules. An example of another binding to Milter, just to name one, is an interface to Amavis.

==== sapi/thttpd ====

  * Server home: http://acme.com/software/thttpd/
  * Server last release: 2014
  * Server debian supported: yes

The latest thttpd version is 2.26, which builds fine. But when building PHP, there's an error message \\
\\
"This version only supports thttpd-2.21b and premium thttpd" \\
\\
But thttpd-2.21b doesn't build anymore, at least at some recent distro i've used. The premium thttpd seems to be a commercial product which isn't available to test with.

  * Dependency home: not available, firebird can be used
  * Dependency debian supported: yes
  * Dependency last release: 2014

Marius Adrian Popa wrote back about an intention to maintain this further in the core together with ext/pdo_firebird. Right now the ext/interbase is half ported to PHP7 (needs cleaning).

**NOTE**: This extension was removed from the voting options, because per the current info it's going to be supported for PHP7 in the future.
\\
==== ext/pdo_oci and ext/oci8 ====

Christopher Jones stated these extensions to be supported by Oracle. Oracle plans to maintains them further in the core.
