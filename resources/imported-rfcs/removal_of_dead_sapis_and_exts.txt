====== PHP RFC: Removal of dead SAPIs and extensions ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2015-01-14
  * Author: Anatol Belski, <ab@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/removal_of_dead_sapis

===== Introduction =====

 Currently PHP contains many SAPIs to the servers either completely unavailable or unsupported for a long time. The same can be said about several extensions which are for long deprecated or their dependency libraries are unsupported. Here's a short list:

 Dead SAPIs:
  * aolserver
  * apache
  * apache_hooks
  * caudium
  * continuity
  * isapi
  * milter  
  * phttpd
  * pi3web
  * roxen
  * thttpd
  * tux
  * webjames
  * apache2filter - not really dead, but currently broken
  * nsapi


 Extensions with unmaintained dependencies

  * imap
  * mcrypt

 Deprecated extensions handled by https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_deprecated_functionality_in_php7 (not handled by this RFC)

  * mysql
  * ereg   

This leads to the situation where the repository contains a lot of unmaintained code. Additionally, especially for xtensions - it just asks for security vulnerabilities.

===== Research =====

==== sapi/aolserver ====


  * Server home: http://sourceforge.net/projects/aolserver/
  * Server last release: 2012
  * SAPI status: to be tested

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOLserver

==== sapi/apache ====

  * Server last release: 2010

Apache 1.x branch not developed anymore since 2010. Also it supports no security updates anymore. 

==== sapi/apache_hooks ====

Same as sapi/apache.

==== sapi/apache2filter ====

This Apache 2.x compatible module seems to have been supported in at least PHP5. In master, it will need to be ported.


==== sapi/caudium ====


  * Sevrer home: http://caudium.net/
  * Server last release: 2012
  * SAPI status: unsupported

The official documentation of Caudium states that PHP can only run as CGI or FCGI http://www.caudium.net/space/documentation/PHP%20Setup . Running PHP as a module is not supported anymore.

==== sapi/continuity ====

No mortal remains of the corresponding server could be found on the internets.

==== sapi/isapi ====

  * Server home: http://www.iis.net/
  * SAPI status: unsupported

The ISAPI support was announced to have been dropped already in the 5.3 migration guide. http://us2.php.net/manual/en/migration53.windows.php . 

==== sapi/milter ====

  * Home: https://www.milter.org/
  * SAPI status: to be tested

Milter is not a web server but an API enabling to hook into different MTAs for mail filtering. PHP scripts running under this SAPI are not dedicated to web development, but would be invoked by the corresponding MTA. In this case also, the corresponding PHP program will need to implement whichever rules. An example of another binding to Milter, just to name one, is an interface to Amavis.

==== sapi/phttpd ===

  * Server home: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~pen/phttpd/
  * Server last release: not sure, development seems to have ended around 2000
  * SAPI status: development incomplete

Comment from the README: THIS IS BY NO MEANS COMPLETE NOR USABLE RIGHT NOW!

==== sapi/pi3web ====

  * Server home: http://pi3web.sourceforge.net/pi3web/
  * Server last release: 2005
  * SAPI status: last commit by the author is in 2004

==== sapi/roxen ====

  * Server Home: http://www.roxen.com/products/cms/webserver/
  * Server last release: 2014
  * SAPI status: experimental

The official documentation http://docs.roxen.com/roxen/5.0/system_developer_manual/languages/php.xml call the only supported mode to be CGI. The SAPI module is called experimental there.

==== sapi/thttpd ====

  * Server home: http://acme.com/software/thttpd/
  * Server last release: 2014
  * SAPI status: to be checked

==== sapi/tux ====

  * Server home: http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/TUX-patches/
  * Server last release: 2006
  * SAPI status: PHP4 compatible

==== sapi/webjames ====
  * Sevrer home: http://www.cp15.org/webjames/
  * Server last release: 2007
  * SAPI status: PHP5.2 compatible

==== sapi/nsapi ====

  * Server home: there seem to be many, but all require some Sun/Oracle environment, more to read here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_iPlanet_Web_Server
  * Server last release: 2014
  * SAPI status: Seems to be PHP5 compatible

This SAPI will need to be ported for PHP7 but I cannot test even whether it even works with PHP5, as I've no Solaris or similar.



==== ext/imap ====
  
  * Dependency home: http://www.washington.edu/imap/
  * Dependency last release: 2007


==== ext/mcrypt ====

  * Dependency home: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcrypt/
  * Dependency last release: 2007

===== Proposal =====

The SAPIs listed above should be removed from the source tree.
The extensions listed above should be moved into PECL.

SAPIs to be unconditionally removed: apache, apache_hooks, caudium, continuity, isapi, phttpd, roxen, pi3web, tux, webjames
SAPIs should be tested: aolserver, milter, thttpd, apache2filter, nsapi

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

7

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

SAPI and extension list in the description.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

Unsupported extensions list in the description.

===== php.ini Defaults =====

php.ini will have to be checked to remove the unavailable config options, if any.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

Should an SAPI or extension come back, the corresponding code is available in the git history.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Remove dead SAPIs, each item separately: yes/no
