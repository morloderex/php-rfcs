====== PHP RFC: Marking overridden methods (#[\Override]) ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2023-05-06
  * Author: Tim Düsterhus, timwolla@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_overriden_methods

===== Introduction =====
The elevator pitch for the RFC. The first paragraph of this section will be slightly larger to give it emphasis; please write a good introduction.

===== Proposal =====
All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.

If applicable, you may wish to use the language specification as a reference.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

<php>Override</php> can no longer be used as a class name in the global namespace. A GitHub search for ''"class Override " language:php symbol:override'' revealed a total of 94 matches in source code. The majority of the matches are namespaced, but there are some occurrences in the global namespace.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next minor (8.3).

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Extensions should possibly add the attribute to their methods where appropriate.

==== To Opcache ====

As the RFC touches inheritance and method definitions, Opcache is likely impacted. During development of the RFC CI pointed out a bug that was since fixed. CI of the current version of the implementation is green, any remaining issues will likely be pointed out during review.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

  * Naming

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Any functionality that is not related to objects and classes is unaffected. Classes that do not leverage inheritance of implement interfaces are unaffected. The entire functionality is opt-in, so existing code is also unaffected.

===== Future Scope =====
