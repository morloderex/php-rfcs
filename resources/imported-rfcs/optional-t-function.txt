===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is proposing to remove the requirement of T_FUNCTION keyword in method declarations if a visibility flag (T_PUBLIC,T_PROTECTED, T_PRIVATE, T_STATIC, T_ABSTRACT, T_FINAL) is given in a class, trait or interface declaration.

===== Syntax =====

It is proposed that this is valid code:

<code php>
class Foo {
    const C = 42;
    private $var;

    public bar() {
        echo "Hello World";
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();
$foo->bar();
</code>

While technically possible this RFC suggests that the following shall **NOT** be valid for keeping the code readable:

<code php>
class Foo {
    const C = 42;
    private $var;

    bar() {
        echo "Hello World";
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();
$foo->bar();
</code>
