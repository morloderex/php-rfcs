====== PHP RFC: Unbundle ext/wddx ======

  * Version: 1.1.1
  * Date: 2018-01-17
  * Author: Christoph M. Becker, <cmb@php.net>
  * Status: Voting
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate-and-remove-ext-wddx

===== Introduction =====

WDDX has been designed as programming language independent data exchange format for the web((http://xml.coverpages.org/wddx0090-dtd-19980928.txt)). However, it never has been formally standardized, and it appears that it has been mostly superseeded by other data exchange formats such as JSON.

A particular problem is that PHP 4.0.0 added the ability to (de)serialize class instances((http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=33eb7d83cab733a3397168d35506e750e1e30d65)) including calls to ''_​_sleep()'' and ''__wakeup()'', respectively. Therefore, ''wddx_deserialize()'' must not be called on untrusted user input to avoid remote code execution, basically defeating the purpose of WDDX. A former RFC proposed to “[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/wddx-deprecate-class-instance-deserialization|Deprecate class instance deserialization in WDDX]]”, but it has been withdrawn since that would break BC, and there seemed to be generally more consensus on deprecating the extension altogether.

===== Proposal =====

Therefore I suggest to unbundle ext/wddx. A secondary vote will be held about the detailed procedure:

  - deprecate all functionality of the extension for PHP 7.4; move to PECL for PHP 8
  - deprecate all functionality of the extension *and* move to PECL for PHP 7.4
  - move the extension to PECL for PHP 7.4
  - dump the extension for PHP 7.4 (unbundle without moving to PECL or somewhere else)


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Obviously, code using the wddx extension would issue deprecation warnings, and/or would have to use the wddx extension from PECL (or somewhere else), or be rewritten.

===== Open Issues =====

  * None

===== Voting =====

The primary vote is about whether to unbundle ext/wddx, which requires a 2/3 majority.

\\ A secondary vote is helt about the detailed procedure (see the [[#proposal|proposal]] above). If the primary vote passes, the alternative with the most votes will be accepted.

\\ Voting starts on 2019-01-17, and ends on 2019-01-31.

===== Patches and Tests =====

None, yet.

===== Implementation =====
