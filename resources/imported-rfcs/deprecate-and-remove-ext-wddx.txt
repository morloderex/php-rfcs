====== PHP RFC: Deprecate and Remove ext/wwdx ======

  * Version: 0.9.1
  * Date: 2018-09-17
  * Author: Christoph M. Becker, <cmb@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

WDDX has been designed as programming language independent data exchange format for the web((http://xml.coverpages.org/wddx0090-dtd-19980928.txt)). However, it never has been formally standardized, and it appears that it has been mostly superseeded by other data exchange formats such as JSON.

A particular problem is that PHP 4.0.0 added the ability to (de)serialize class instances((http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=33eb7d83cab733a3397168d35506e750e1e30d65)) including calls to ''_​_sleep()'' and ''__wakeup()'', respectively. Therefore, ''wddx_deserialize()'' must not be called on untrusted user input to avoid remote code execution, basically defeating the purpose of WDDX. A former RFC proposed to “[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/wddx-deprecate-class-instance-deserialization|Deprecate class instance deserialization in WDDX]]”, but it has been withdrawn since that would break BC, and there seemed to be generally more consensus on deprecating the extension altogether.

===== Proposal =====

Therefore I suggest the following procedure:

  * PHP 7.4: deprecate ext/wddx (particularly issue E_DEPRECATED whenever a ''wddx_*()'' function is called)
  * PHP 8.0: move ext/wddx to PECL/wddx (without removing the deprecation)

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Obviously, code using the wddx extension would issue deprecation warnings, and would have to use the wddx extension from PECL as of PHP 8.0, or be rewritten.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Whether to implement the proposal above, or not.

This RFC requires a 2/3 majority

===== Patches and Tests =====

None, yet.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
