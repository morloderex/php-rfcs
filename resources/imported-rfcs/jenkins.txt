===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to introduce the idea of using [[http://jenkins-ci.org/|Jenkins]] for Continuous Integration in the PHP project supported with a Proof of concept implementation.


===== Why do we need CI? =====

  * Runs the build and the tests automatically, doesn't require human interaction to spot build and test failures.
  * Provides a solid baseline for others to check that they are seeing a problem or it is just some configuration problem on their end.
  * Provides an easy way to check the build status and the test results for different platform/environments (different cpu architectures, OS, etc.).
  * Allows us to follow the build trends and history.

===== gcov.php.net =====
  * gcov.php.net is an in-house php application written in php: http://svn.php.net/viewvc/web/php-gcov/trunk/
  * gcov.php.net didn't got 
  * gcov.php.net does a throughout analysis (building the supported php versions and executing the testsuite with [[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html|gcov]] and [[http://valgrind.org/|Valgrind]] for test coverage and memory leaks.
  * gcov.php.net does a throughout analysis, but having to wait more than 2 days for a build result isn't really useful for checking build or test failures early.
  * gcov.php.net doesn't support distributed builds out-of-the-box.
  * the development of gcov.php.net and the related work seems halted in the absence of Nuno Lopes.
