====== Request for Comments: Continuous Integration via Jenkins ======

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to introduce the idea of using [[http://jenkins-ci.org/|Jenkins]] for Continuous Integration in the PHP project supported with a Proof of concept implementation.


===== Why do we need CI? =====

  * Runs the build and the tests automatically, doesn't require human interaction to spot build and test failures.
  * Provides a solid baseline for others to check that they are seeing a problem or it is just some configuration problem on their end.
  * Provides an easy way to check the build status and the test results for different platform/environments (different cpu architectures, OS, etc.).
  * Allows us to follow the build trends and history.

===== gcov.php.net =====
  * gcov.php.net is an in-house php application written in php: http://svn.php.net/viewvc/web/php-gcov/trunk/
  * gcov.php.net does a throughout analysis (building the supported php versions and executing the testsuite with [[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html|gcov]], [[http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php|lcov]] and [[http://valgrind.org/|Valgrind]] for test coverage and memory leaks, and does some [[https://wiki.php.net/ideas/automaticcodechecker|code checking]].
  * gcov.php.net does a throughout analysis, but having to wait more than 2 days for a build result isn't really useful for checking build or test failures early.
  * the development of gcov.php.net and the related work seems halted in the absence of Nuno Lopes.

===== Why Jenkins? =====
  * Currently it is 

===== Other alternatives =====
  * [[http://svn.php.net/viewvc/web/php-rmtools/trunk/|rmtools]]: Pierre and Dan is [[http://www.mail-archive.com/internals@lists.php.net/msg53358.html|working on]] a distributed build environment.
  * For the record: the PEAR group [[https://wiki.php.net/pear/qa/ci|is using/used]] PHPUnderControl which is a patchset on top of CruiseControl(another java based CI tool), which could also be used for building php-src, but it doesn't really have anything over Jenkins and the development seems halted: the last version is more than a year old. 
  * other CI tools (there is a whole bunch)

===== Changelog =====
