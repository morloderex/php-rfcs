===== Introduction =====

Coming to Object-Orientated Programming, PHP offers a variety of possibilities to obtain information about classes and their instances (objects). In this regard, the classes/objects functions (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.classobj.php) as well as the reflection API (http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php) do a great job. But still there is no function to obtain a particular information: the number of instances of a class. 

One might say, simply implement a static counter in each class. But what about built-in classes like SPL? A wrapper would be required. Implementing it these ways, it does not only sound, but it actually is cumbersome. The purpose of this RFC is to address this issue.

===== Proposal =====

The proposal is to add a new function returning an array ('name of the class' => number of instances) in the current script.

The function name should fit in with the current names of class/object functions. Therefore, the name **get_objects_count()** seems to be reasonable, but is still up for discussion (see [[#Function name]]).

Example #1:
<code php>
print_r (get_objects_count());
// Array ()

$foo = new StdClass;

print_r (get_objects_count());
// Array ( [StdClass] => 1 )

$bar = new StdClass;

print_r (get_objects_count());
// Array ( [StdClass] => 2 )
</code>

===== Function name =====

Further suggestions for the function name in example #1:
<code>
// Proposed
get_objects_count()

// Alternatives
get_instances_counts()
get_instances_count()
get_instance_counts()
get_object_store_count()
get_class_counts() 
</code>
