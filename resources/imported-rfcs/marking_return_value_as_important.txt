====== PHP RFC: Marking return values as important (#[\NoDiscard]) ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2025-01-27
  * Author: Tim Düsterhus (tim@tideways-gmbh.com), Volker Dusch (volker@tideways-gmbh.com)
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

PHP’s error handling mechanism of choice in newer APIs is the use of Exceptions, where forgetting to handle the failure case results in a very obvious error, when the functionality fails. However not all functionality maps to a binary result of either succeeding or failing, instead also supporting a “partial success” state.

This kind of “partial success” can only be reliably communicated by means of a return value, where forgetting to check the return value might result in silent failure. Depending on the nature of the API, the failure case might be rare or non-deterministic, making it hard to notice the issue on a cursory glance.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes a new attribute <php>#[\NoDiscard]</php> that allows to indicate that the return value of a function or method is “important” and that not doing anything with the return value is likely to be a bug. In the interest of readability, the term “function” shall mean “function or method” in the rest of the RFC text.

<PHP>
#[Attribute(Attribute::TARGET_METHOD|Attribute::TARGET_FUNCTION)]
final class NoDiscard
{
    public readonly ?string $message;

    public function __construct(?string $message = null) {}
}
</PHP>

When calling a function with the <php>#[\NoDiscard]</php> attribute, the engine shall validate whether or not the return value of the function is used and emit a <php>E_WARNING</php> (for native functions) or <php>E_USER_WARNING</php> (for userland functions) if the return value is not used.

The <php>$message</php> property of the <php>#[\NoDiscard]</php> attribute shall be part of the emitted warning, similar to the functionality of the [[rfc:deprecated_attribute|#[\Deprecated] attribute]].

“Using the return value” means that the returned value is part of any other expressions, it does not require the expression to be useful. As an example, assigning the return value to a dummy variable will be considered using the return value, as will casting the return value and not using the result of the cast. It should however be noted that OPcache might optimize away this kind of useless operations. Therefore this RFC also proposes a new <php>(void)</php> cast that may be used to make indicate that not using the value of an expression (or more specifically of a function call) is intentional. The <php>(void)</php> cast may only use used as part of a statement, not as part of an expression, using it within an expression will result in a syntax error.

==== Implementation Details ====

The engine will verify whether the return value is used right //before// calling the function, and //after// evaluating the parameters. This means that using a throwing error handler will result in the function not being called. This is for two reasons:

  * The primary reason is performance: Performing this check before calling the function allows:
      * to merge the check with the deprecation check, and also
      * to make use of “opcode specialization” to remove the check if the return value is known to be used.
  * As the attribute is intended to be used on functions where not using the return value is “unsafe”, not calling the function if the return value is not used and a throwing error handler is active results in a “fail-closed” mechanism, implicitly doing the “safer” thing.

==== Examples ====

<PHP>
<?php

enum Status
{
	case Success;
	case Failure;
}

/**
 * Processes all the given items.
 * 
 * @param array<string> $items
 * @return array<Status>
 */
#[\NoDiscard("as processing might fail for individual items")]
function bulk_process(array $items): array
{
	$results = [];

	foreach ($items as $key => $item) {
		if (\random_int(0, 9999) < 9999) {
			// Pretend to do something useful with $item, which will succeed in 99.99% of cases.
			echo "Processing {$item}", PHP_EOL;
			$status = Status::Success;
		} else {
			$status = Status::Failure;
		}

		$results[$key] = $status;
	}

	return $results;
}

$items = [
	'foo',
	'bar',
	'baz',
];

// Warning: The return value of function bulk_process() is expected to be consumed, as processing might fail for individual items in test.php on line 40
bulk_process($items);

// No warning, because the return value is consumed by the assignment.
$results = bulk_process($items);

// No warning, because the (void) cast is used.
(void)bulk_process($items);

// No warning, because the return value is consumed by the cast (but the (bool) cast may be optimized away by OPcache).
(bool)bulk_process($items);
</PHP>

<PHP>
<?php

#[\NoDiscard("as processing might fail for individual items")]
function bulk_process(array $items): array
{
	return [];
}

$items = [
	'foo',
	'bar',
	'baz',
];

// Parse error: syntax error, unexpected token "(void)" in test.php on line 16
if ((void)bulk_process($items)) {
	// …
}
</PHP>

<PHP>
<?php

set_error_handler(static function (int $errno, string $errstr, ?string $errfile = null, ?int $errline = null) {
	throw new \ErrorException($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);
});

#[\NoDiscard("as processing might fail for individual items")]
function bulk_process(array $items): array
{
	echo __FUNCTION__, PHP_EOL;

	return [];
}

function get_items(): array
{
	echo __FUNCTION__, PHP_EOL;

	return [
		'foo',
		'bar',
		'baz',
	];
}

try {
	// Prints: get_items
	bulk_process(get_items());
} catch (\Exception $e) {
	// Prints: The return value of function bulk_process() is expected to be consumed, as processing might fail for individual items
	echo $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
</PHP>

==== Recommended usage ====

The attribute is intended to be used on functions where the user of the function is likely to forget using the return value by accident and where not using the return value will result in buggy behavior that is hard to detect during testing.

The above example of the <php>bulk_process()</php> function is a good use-case. It is a function with side-effects and it will correctly process all the items in the vast majority of the cases, making it easy to miss the failure case when testing the functionality.

<php>str_contains()</php> on the other hand is likely to be a bad use-case. It is unlikely for a developer to call <php>str_contains()</php> and not do anything with the result, as the function does not result in side-effects (other than implicitly casting the arguments to strings). If the developer forgets to use the return value anyways, it will just result in unnecessary processing without any further negative effects. The same reasoning applies to most “pure” functions.

==== Native functions where the attribute is applied ====

As part of this RFC, the following native functions shall have the attribute applied:

  * <php>flock()</php>: Ignoring the failure to obtain a lock might result in silent data corruption. Exception-based error handling cannot be used, due to the <php>LOCK_NB</php> flag, which is meant to gracefully handle files that are already locked. Furthermore issues in locking will only appear under heavy contention, making it hard to find issues by automated testing.
  * <php>DateTimeImmutable::set*()</php>: The methods are badly named, because they do not actually set the updated value the <php>DateTimeImmutable</php> object itself, but return a new instance instead. An established naming scheme for this kind of method would nowadays be <php>with*()</php>. This naming can lead to subtle issues when forgetting to use the return value when migrating from <php>DateTime</php> to <php>DateTimeImmutable</php>.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

The class-name <php>NoDiscard</php> will no longer be available within the global namespace. A GitHub search for [[https://github.com/search?q=language%3APHP%20symbol%3ANoDiscard&type=code|language:PHP symbol:NoDiscard]] does not reveal any use of this class-name, making this a theoretical issue.

Functions having the attribute might emit a <php>E_WARNING</php> if they are used in an unsafe fashion. If a throwing error handler is used this may result in a breaking change. As the attribute shall only be applied to functions where not using the return value has a significant impact on correct functionality, we consider the benefit of pointing out the error to the user to outweigh the drawbacks, since suppressing the error by assigning to a dummy variable can be reliably performed in a way that is compatible with older PHP versions.

Using the <php>(void)</php> cast would previously result in a compile-time error, adding the <php>(void)</php> does therefore does not result in a backwards-incompatible change per se, but as it adds a new token to PHP’s tokenizer and changes the grammar of the language, it has an effect on static analysis tools and IDEs to understand the syntax.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x (8.5).

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

None.

==== To Opcache ====

The attribute adds new semantics to a function or method call and thus requires changes to OPcache. The current implementation already passes all tests with OPcache enabled, but it does not yet include JIT support.

==== New Constants ====

  * <php>T_VOID_CAST</php> in ext/tokenizer.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

This RFC only affects calls to functions and methods that have the attribute applied, this includes a limited number of native functions and methods that is listed above. Calls to other functions or methods and any other functionality is unaffected.

===== Future Scope =====

None.
