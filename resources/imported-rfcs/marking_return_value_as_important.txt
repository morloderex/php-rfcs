====== PHP RFC: Marking return values as important (#[\NoDiscard]) ======
  * Version: 1.0

This is a suggested template for PHP Request for Comments (RFCs). Change this template to suit your RFC.  Not all RFCs need to be tightly specified.  Not all RFCs need all the sections below.
Read https://wiki.php.net/rfc/howto carefully!


Quoting [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/71525|Rasmus]]:

> PHP is and should remain:
> 1) a pragmatic web-focused language
> 2) a loosely typed language
> 3) a language which caters to the skill-levels and platforms of a wide range of users

Your RFC should move PHP forward following his vision. As [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66065|said by Zeev Suraski]] "Consider only features which have significant traction to a
large chunk of our userbase, and not something that could be useful in some
extremely specialized edge cases [...] Make sure you think about the full context, the huge audience out there, the consequences of  making the learning curve steeper with
every new feature, and the scope of the goodness that those new features bring."

===== Introduction =====
The elevator pitch for the RFC. The first paragraph of this section will be slightly larger to give it emphasis; please write a good introduction.

===== Proposal =====
All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain how the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.

If applicable, you may wish to use the language specification as a reference.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x (8.5).

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

None.

==== To Opcache ====

The attribute adds new semantics to a function or method call and thus requires changes to OPcache. The current implementation already passes all tests with OPcache enabled, but it does not yet include JIT support.

==== New Constants ====

None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

None.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This section details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

   * Yes
   * No
</doodle>

<doodle title="Implement the (void) cast to reliably suppress #[\NoDiscard]?" auth="timwolla" voteType="single" closed="true" closeon="2024-11-27T14:00:00Z">
   * Yes
   * No
</doodle>

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====

None.
