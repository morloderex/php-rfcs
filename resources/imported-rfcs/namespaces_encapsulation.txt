This RFC is a template other people can use to write their own RFCs.

===== Introduction =====

This RFC introduce and suggest adding encapsulation abilities into classes.
Today, namespaces is a tool used to avoid conflicts with other classes and help improve performance. However, with encapsulation abilities to classes, namespaces can be even better.

Today, when one declare few classes, all of them can be accessed and initialized (though you can disable it using private constructor, which is a different story). from any scope - the global scope and namespace specific.

There are cases which programmer wish, just like when using private class members, to encapsulate and make some classes available only from the namespace it was created in.

==== Why do we need RFCs? ====

They serve to keep a summary of on going discussions. This way people can keep an overview of the state of the discussion. Even if never put into place in the end, they also serve as a historical log of discussions that is much easier to read compared to mailinglist threads.

===== Common Misconceptions =====

RFCs do not in any way replace discussions on the mailing list.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

Nothing needs to be patched here. Just use this template at your discretion.

==== Rejected Features ====
