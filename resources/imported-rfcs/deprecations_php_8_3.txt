===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.3 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * Passing negative ''$width''s to ''mb_strimwidth()''


===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.3 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== Passing negative $widths to mb_strimwidth() ====

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.3 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 9.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.
