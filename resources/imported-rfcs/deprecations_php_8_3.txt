===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.3 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * Passing negative ''$width''s to ''mb_strimwidth()''
  * The NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY constant
  * Unnecessary ''crypt()'' related constants
  * MT_RAND_PHP
  * Global Mersenne Twister

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.3 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== Passing negative $widths to mb_strimwidth() ====

Regarding the ''$width'' argument of ''mb_strimwidth()'', the PHP manual states: "Negative widths count from the end of the string." In other words, if ''$width'' is -2, then either two halfwidth characters or one fullwidth character should be trimmed from the end of the string.

This feature was introduced in git revision 70187267b4 (January 2016), and was contributed by Francois Laupretre <francois@php.net>.

Although I have not seen anything written by F. Laupretre to explain what the anticipated usage of the feature was, it seems to have very limited utility. ''mb_strimwidth()'' is typically used to trim strings down to a length which can be printed in a terminal without wrapping. It seems very unusual that anyone would want to set the terminal width of a string to "its current value less N". (One possibility is that the feature was introduced for consistency with other standard library functions which accept a negative argument to indicate "count back from the end of a string".)

From the time the feature was merged until now, it has always had a bug when combined with a non-zero ''$from'' argument. The implementation does arithmetic which combines //codepoint counts// with //terminal width counts//, with erroneous results. (This is just like the proverbial "apples and oranges".) If there are any fullwidth characters in the prefix which is skipped because of non-zero ''$from'', then ''mb_strimwidth()'' will not trim the requested width from the end of the string.

It is notable that in 9 years, no user ever noticed and reported this bug. My guess is that almost no-one uses the negative width feature. This would explain why the bug was not noticed.

To implement the feature correctly, without the bug mentioned above, an extra pass over the prefix of the input string identified by ''$from'' would be needed to determine its terminal width. This operation requires O(n) time.

When preparing this RFC, I searched the Internet for existing open-source software which uses ''mb_strimwidth()'' and reviewed over 100 such projects. None of them used negative ''$width'' arguments. However, if readers are aware of existing projects which rely on the negative ''$width'' feature, please add that information here.

==== The NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY constant ====

This constant is unused since it was added to PHP (in PHP 5.3 or before), likely it was meant to call <php>NumberFormatter::formatCurrency()</php>/<php>NumberFormatter::parseCurrency()</php> from <php>NumberFormatter::format()</php>/<php>NumberFormatter::parse()</php> respectively.
However, this was never implemented, likely because there is no way to pass the necessary currency argument.

==== Unnecessary crypt() related constants ====

There are a couple of constants which store some information about the current system related to the ''crypt()'' function:

  * ''CRYPT_STD_DES'': whether standard DES salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_BLOWFISH'': whether BlowFish salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_EXT_DES'': whether extended DES salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_MD5'': whether MD5 salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_SHA256'': whether SHA-256 salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_SHA512'': whether SHA-512 salts are supported

However, these constants are always ''1'' since a long time (at least 6 years), because the above salts are supported on all systems. Therefore, they are unnecessary, and they give a false impression that the capabilities in question are conditionally available.

==== MT_RAND_PHP ====

Authors: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>, Go Kudo <zeriyoshi@php.net>

The implementation of Mt19937 ("Mersenne Twister") in PHP versions before 7.1 contains two bugs:

  * <php>mt_rand()</php> without parameters returns different numbers than the reference implementation, due to a typo in a variable name.
  * <php>mt_rand($min, $max)</php> with a restricted range uses a broken scaling algorithm based on floating point arithmetic. As doubles have only 53 Bits of precision, this will introduce a bias if a range larger than 53 Bits is requested.

Both of these issues were fixed in PHP 7.1 by the [[rfc:rng_fixes|RNG fixes and changes RFC]] that also aliased <php>rand()</php> to <php>mt_rand()</php>. The <php>MT_RAND_PHP</php> constant was added to allow developers that rely on a specific sequence for a given seed to opt into the old implementation with the non-standard Mt19937 algorithm and the biased scaler.

The object-oriented <php>Mt19937</php> engine that was introduced in the [[rfc:rng_extension|Random Extension 5.x RFC]] in PHP 8.2 also supports the <php>MT_RAND_PHP</php> option to allow developers a smooth migration from the global instance of Mt19937 as used with <php>mt_rand()</php> to the object-oriented <php>Random\Randomizer</php>.

Supporting the biased scaler with the object-oriented API requires a special case for Mt19937 in the internal implementation. It furthermore [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/9197|required a fix (PR 9197)]], because the biased scaler in PHP 8.1 and earlier exhibits undefined behavior that was only caught by the newly added tests in PHP 8.2. Thus the behavior for certain inputs changed between PHP 8.1 and PHP 8.2 and could not be relied on even in older versions, as the results depend on the compiler used.

The only purpose of the constant/broken mode is backwards compatibility, but this cannot be achieved, due to the bad scaler being broken by design and relying on undefined behavior. As such it fails at its sole purpose. The bad scaling is also intransparent to the developer, as it silently returns biased results for certain inputs.

To clean up the special cases internal implementation and to clean up the API for the developer, <php>MT_RAND_PHP</php> should be deprecated.

==== Global Mersenne Twister ====

Authors: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>, Go Kudo <zeriyoshi@php.net>

Before PHP 8.2, PHP provided two kinds of random number generators. A seedable random number generator using the Mt19937 ("Mersenne Twister") algorithm and a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). The former stores its state in an implicit global variable and the latter is not seedable. This made it hard to achieve reproducible results for testing, as the use of an implicit global variable makes it hard to determine what operation modify the Mt19937 state, thus changing future values.

To fix this [[rfc:rng_extension|Random Extension 5.x]] RFC for PHP 8.2 introduces object-based random number algorithms (“Engines”) that store their entire state within an object. Generating numbers with one object, won't affect the sequence of another object.

The API of the random extension that relates to the generation of random integers currently looks like the following:

  * Global Mt19937
    * <php>mt_rand()</php>
    * <php>mt_srand()</php>
    * <php>mt_getrandmax()</php>
    * <php>rand()</php> (alias for mt_rand() since PHP 7.1)
    * <php>srand()</php> (alias for mt_srand() since PHP 7.1)
    * <php>getrandmax()</php> (alias for mt_getrandmax() since PHP 7.1)
  * CSPRNG
    * <php>random_int()</php>
  * <php>\Random\Randomizer</php>
    * <php>->getInt()</php>

Thus there are three functions returning a random integer (<php>mt_rand()</php>, <php>rand()</php>, <php>random_int()</php>) and the object-based and pluggable <php>Randomizer::getInt()</php>.

The functions using the global Mt19937 instance are the worst choice:

  * They are not cryptographically secure.
  * They are not properly reproducible, because the state could be changed unpredictably by any function call, e.g. when a library is updated and adds additional calls to <php>mt_rand()</php>.
  * Any function calling <php>mt_srand()</php> with a fixed seed for whatever reason, will ruin randomness for the remainder of the request.
  * PHP's Mt19937 implementation only supports passing a single 32 bit integer as the initial seed. Thus there are only ~4 billion possible sequences of random integers generated by Mt19937. If a random seed is used, collisions are expected with 50% probability after roughly 2**16 seeds (as per the birthday paradox). In other words: After roughly 70000 requests without explicit seeding it is likely that a seed and thus a sequence is reused.
  * Both the quality of the returned randomness as well as the generation performance of Mt19937 is worse than that of the Xoshiro256StarStar and PcgOneseq128XslRr64 engines that are provided in the object-oriented API.

But at the same time the functions using the global Mt19937 instance are the obvious choice for less experienced developers: The function names are the shortest ones and they appear to do the right thing at a first glance. Due to their age they also made their way into various tutorials and StackOverflow answers and thus code bases, possibly causing security issues when the use case would have required the use of cryptographically secure randomness. As an example a [[https://github.com/search?q=%22four+most+significant+bits+holds+version+number+4%22+language%3APHP&type=code&l=PHP|GitHub Search]] reveals that UUIDv4 implementations based on a [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/2040279|highly-voted Y2010 StackOverflow answer]] that uses <php>mt_rand()</php> are not uncommon, as per above, UUID collisions are expected after 70000 requests if nothing else uses randomness within the request.

The limitations of the global Mt19937 are effectively unfixable by modifying the existing functions, because developers expect to be able to retrieve a specific sequence with a given seed (even when considering that any function call could unpredictably change the state).

To clean up the API and to guide developers to better alternatives, the global Mt19937 should be deprecated and then removed. The function-based API will then provide just the <php>random_int()</php> function which is the “secure by default” choice based on the CSPRNG. If reproducible sequences are required, the Xoshiro256StarStar and PcgOneseq128XslRr64 engines of the object-oriented API provide high-quality randomness, great performance and much larger initial seeds.

If reproducing existing Mt19937 sequences is required, the object-oriented API provides a drop-in replacement for the global Mt19937 using the <php>\Random\Engine\Mt19937</php> class.

The following functions shall be deprecated:

  * <php>mt_rand()</php>
  * <php>mt_srand()</php>
  * <php>mt_getrandmax()</php>
  * <php>rand()</php>
  * <php>srand()</php>
  * <php>getrandmax()</php>

A userland replacement can be written by leveraging <php>$GLOBALS</php> to store an <php>\Random\Randomizer</php> object with a <php>\Random\Engine\Mt19937</php> engine ([[https://3v4l.org/B18he|https://3v4l.org/B18he]]):

<PHP>
<?php

function my_mt_srand(?int $seed = null) {
	$GLOBALS['my_mt_rand'] = new \Random\Randomizer(new \Random\Engine\Mt19937($seed));
}
function my_mt_rand($min = null, $max = null) {
	if (!isset($GLOBALS['my_mt_rand'])) {
		$GLOBALS['my_mt_rand'] = new \Random\Randomizer(new \Random\Engine\Mt19937());
	}

	if ($min === null && $max === null) {
		return $GLOBALS['my_mt_rand']->nextInt();
	}

	return $GLOBALS['my_mt_rand']->getInt($min, $max);
}

mt_srand(1234);
my_mt_srand(1234);

var_dump(mt_rand());
var_dump(my_mt_rand());
var_dump(mt_rand(1, 1000));
var_dump(my_mt_rand(1, 1000));
</PHP>

In addition to the 6 functions related to integer generation, the global Mt19937 is also used for the following functions:

  * <php>array_rand()</php>
  * <php>shuffle()</php>
  * <php>str_shuffle()</php>

The proposed deprecation and removal of <php>mt_srand()</php> will affect these functions, as they will no longer be seedable, thus a decision needs to be taken with regard to the behavior of these functions, if the global Mt19937 is removed. There are two options:

  * Deprecate and remove <php>array_rand()</php>, <php>shuffle()</php>, <php>str_shuffle()</php>. A drop-in replacement is available by using <php>\Random\Randomizer</php>
  * Migrate <php>array_rand()</php>, <php>shuffle()</php>, <php>str_shuffle()</php> to use the CSPRNG internally. The functions will still be available, but no longer seedable.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.3 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 9.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.
