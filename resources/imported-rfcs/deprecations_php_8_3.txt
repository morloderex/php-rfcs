===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.3 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * Passing negative ''$width''s to ''mb_strimwidth()''
  * The NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY constant
  * Unnecessary ''crypt()'' related constants
  * MT_RAND_PHP
  * Global Mersenne Twister

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.3 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== Passing negative $widths to mb_strimwidth() ====

Regarding the ''$width'' argument of ''mb_strimwidth()'', the PHP manual states: "Negative widths count from the end of the string." In other words, if ''$width'' is -2, then either two halfwidth characters or one fullwidth character should be trimmed from the end of the string.

This feature was introduced in git revision 70187267b4 (January 2016), and was contributed by Francois Laupretre <francois@php.net>.

Although I have not seen anything written by F. Laupretre to explain what the anticipated usage of the feature was, it seems to have very limited utility. ''mb_strimwidth()'' is typically used to trim strings down to a length which can be printed in a terminal without wrapping. It seems very unusual that anyone would want to set the terminal width of a string to "its current value less N". (One possibility is that the feature was introduced for consistency with other standard library functions which accept a negative argument to indicate "count back from the end of a string".)

From the time the feature was merged until now, it has always had a bug when combined with a non-zero ''$from'' argument. The implementation does arithmetic which combines //codepoint counts// with //terminal width counts//, with erroneous results. (This is just like the proverbial "apples and oranges".) If there are any fullwidth characters in the prefix which is skipped because of non-zero ''$from'', then ''mb_strimwidth()'' will not trim the requested width from the end of the string.

It is notable that in 9 years, no user ever noticed and reported this bug. My guess is that almost no-one uses the negative width feature. This would explain why the bug was not noticed.

To implement the feature correctly, without the bug mentioned above, an extra pass over the prefix of the input string identified by ''$from'' would be needed to determine its terminal width. This operation requires O(n) time.

When preparing this RFC, I searched the Internet for existing open-source software which uses ''mb_strimwidth()'' and reviewed over 100 such projects. None of them used negative ''$width'' arguments. However, if readers are aware of existing projects which rely on the negative ''$width'' feature, please add that information here.

==== The NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY constant ====

This constant is unused since it was added to PHP (in PHP 5.3 or before), likely it was meant to call <php>NumberFormatter::formatCurrency()</php>/<php>NumberFormatter::parseCurrency()</php> from <php>NumberFormatter::format()</php>/<php>NumberFormatter::parse()</php> respectively.
However, this was never implemented, likely because there is no way to pass the necessary currency argument.

==== Unnecessary crypt() related constants ====

There are a couple of constants which store some information about the current system related to the ''crypt()'' function:

  * ''CRYPT_STD_DES'': whether standard DES salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_BLOWFISH'': whether BlowFish salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_EXT_DES'': whether extended DES salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_MD5'': whether MD5 salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_SHA256'': whether SHA-256 salts are supported
  * ''CRYPT_SHA512'': whether SHA-512 salts are supported

However, these constants are always ''1'' since a long time (at least 6 years), because the above salts are supported on all systems. Therefore, they are unnecessary, and they give a false impression that the capabilities in question are conditionally available.

==== MT_RAND_PHP ====

Authors: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>, Go Kudo <zeriyoshi@php.net>

The implementation of Mt19937 ("Mersenne Twister") in PHP versions before 7.1 contains two bugs:

  * <php>mt_rand()</php> without parameters returns different numbers than the reference implementation, due to a typo in a variable name.
  * <php>mt_rand($min, $max)</php> with a restricted range uses a broken scaling algorithm based on floating point arithmetic. As doubles have only 53 Bits of precision, this will introduce a bias if a range larger than 53 Bits is requested.

Both of these issues were fixed in PHP 7.1 by the [[rfc:rng_fixes|RNG fixes and changes RFC]] that also aliased <php>rand()</php> to <php>mt_rand()</php>. The <php>MT_RAND_PHP</php> constant was added to allow developers that rely on a specific sequence for a given seed to opt into the old implementation with the non-standard Mt19937 algorithm and the biased scaler.

The object-oriented <php>Mt19937</php> engine that was introduced in the [[rfc:rng_extension|Random Extension 5.x RFC]] in PHP 8.2 also supports the <php>MT_RAND_PHP</php> option to allow developers a smooth migration from the global instance of Mt19937 as used with <php>mt_rand()</php> to the object-oriented <php>Random\Randomizer</php>.

Supporting the biased scaler with the object-oriented API requires a special case for Mt19937 in the internal implementation. It furthermore [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/9197|required a fix (PR 9197)]], because the biased scaler in PHP 8.1 and earlier exhibits undefined behavior that was only caught by the newly added tests in PHP 8.2. Thus the behavior for certain inputs changed between PHP 8.1 and PHP 8.2 and could not be relied on even in older versions, as the results depend on the compiler used.

The only purpose of the constant/broken mode is backwards compatibility, but this cannot be achieved, due to the bad scaler being broken by design and relying on undefined behavior. As such it fails at its sole purpose. The bad scaling is also intransparent to the developer, as it silently returns biased results for certain inputs.

To clean up the special cases internal implementation and to clean up the API for the developer, <php>MT_RAND_PHP</php> should be deprecated.

==== Global Mersenne Twister ====

Authors: Tim Düsterhus <timwolla@php.net>, Go Kudo <zeriyoshi@php.net>

Before PHP 8.2, PHP provided two kinds of random number generators. A seedable random number generator using the Mt19937 ("Mersenne Twister") algorithm and a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). The former stores its state in an implicit global variable and the latter is not seedable. This made it hard to achieve reproducible results for testing, as the global variable makes it hard to determine what operation modify the Mt19937 state, thus changing future values. 

To fix this [[rfc:rng_extension|Random Extension 5.x]] RFC for PHP 8.2 introduces object-based random number algorithms (“Engines”) that store their entire state within an object. Generating numbers with one object, won't affect the sequence of another object.

The API of the random extension that relates to the generation of random integers currently looks like the following:

  * Global Mt19937
    * <php>mt_rand()</php>
    * <php>mt_srand()</php>
    * <php>mt_getrandmax()</php>
    * <php>rand()</php> (alias for mt_rand() since PHP 7.1)
    * <php>srand()</php> (alias for mt_srand() since PHP 7.1)
    * <php>getrandmax()</php> (alias for mt_getrandmax() since PHP 7.1)
  * CSPRNG
    * <php>random_int()</php>
  * <php>\Random\Randomizer</php>
    * <php>->getInt()</php>

Thus there are three functions returning a random integer (<php>mt_rand()</php>, <php>rand()</php>, <php>random_int()</php>) and the object-based and pluggable <php>Randomizer::getInt()</php>.

The functions using the global Mt19937 instance are the worst choice, they are neither cryptographically secure, nor properly reproducible, but at the same time they are also the easiest to use, as the function names are the shortest ones.

To clean up the API and avoid the “global state” gotcha the global Mt19937 should be removed. The function-based API will then provide just the secure <php>random_int()</php> function which is the safe default choice. If a reproducible sequence is desired, the object-oriented API provides a drop-in replacement for the global Mt19937 using the <php>\Random\Engine\Mt19937</php> class. Thus the following functions shall be deprecated:

  * <php>mt_rand()</php>
  * <php>mt_srand()</php>
  * <php>mt_getrandmax()</php>
  * <php>rand()</php>
  * <php>srand()</php>
  * <php>getrandmax()</php>

A userland replacement can be written by leveraging <php>$GLOBALS</php> to store an <php>\Random\Randomizer</php> object with a <php>\Random\Engine\Mt19937</php> engine.

   * Yes
   * No
</doodle>

In addition to the 6 functions related to integer generation, the global Mt19937 is also used for the following functions:

  * <php>array_rand()</php>
  * <php>shuffle()</php>
  * <php>str_shuffle()</php>

The proposed deprecation and removal of <php>mt_srand()</php> will affect these functions, as they will no longer be seedable, thus a decision needs to be taken with regard to the behavior of these functions, if the global Mt19937 is removed. There are two options:

  * Deprecate and remove <php>array_rand()</php>, <php>shuffle()</php>, <php>str_shuffle()</php>. A drop-in replacement is available by using <php>\Random\Randomizer</php>
  * Migrate <php>array_rand()</php>, <php>shuffle()</php>, <php>str_shuffle()</php> to use the CSPRNG internally. The functions will still be available, but no longer seedable.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.3 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 9.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.
