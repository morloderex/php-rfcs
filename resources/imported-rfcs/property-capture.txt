===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes the addition of an inline syntax for lexical (captured) variables when declaring anonymous classes in PHP. The goal is to simplify anonymous class declarations and make them more concise by allowing developers to capture variables from the outer scope directly. 

Anonymous classes were introduced in PHP 7.0, using a syntax that allows declaring a class definition and constructing an instance in a single statement. However, unlike anonymous functions, it is not easy to "capture" values from the parent scope for use inside the class; they can only be passed in via an explicit constructor or other method.

This RFC proposes a "property capture" syntax, where a property can be declared and initialised with <php>$instance = new class use($captured) {};</php> Optional access modifiers, type, and renaming are also supported, e.g. <php>$instance = new class use($localName as private readonly int $propertyName) {};</php>

===== Semantics =====

Capturing variables into an anonymous class instance requires two things:

  - A way to refer to the captured variables inside the //class definition//, which is compiled once, when the statement is first run
  - A way to associate values with these variables for //a particular instance//, which will vary each time the statement is run

Rather than inventing new syntax and semantics for these, this proposal reuses existing object properties and constructor parameters, as follows:

  - If a ''use'' clause is present, generate an empty constructor which will be added to the anonymous class.
  - For each captured variable in the ''use'' clause, add it as a parameter to the constructor.
  - Declare a property with the same name as the captured variable in the anonymous class, unless renamed in the ''use'' clause (see below).
  - Set the default visibility of the property to ''public'' and the default type to ''mixed'' if not specified in the ''use'' clause (see below).
  - In the constructor body, assign the captured variable to the corresponding property.
  - When creating an //instance// of the anonymous class, pass the variables listed as parameters to the constructor.

The implementation reuses a lot of mechanics from the existing Constructor Property Promotion mechanism, but this is considered an implementation detail, not a functional guarantee.

===== Syntax =====

A new //''use'' clause// is introduced, immediately after the keywords "new class", with the syntax ''use (<var-name> as <modifiers> <type> <property-name>, ...)''. The ''<modifiers>'', ''<type>'', and ''<property-name>'' are all optional; if none is specified, the "as" keyword must be omitted.

==== Basic Form ====

The simplest form of property capture resembles the capture list of anonymous functions:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
$anon = new class use ($foo, $bar) {};
</code>

This declares a class with public untyped properties ''$foo'' and ''$bar'', and creates an instance populating them from the outer variables ''$foo'' and ''$bar''. In other words, it is equivalent to this:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
$anon = new class($foo, $bar) {
    var $foo;
    var $bar;
    
    public function __construct($foo, $bar) {
        $this->foo = $foo;
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }
};
</code>

==== Renaming ====

By default, the property takes the same name as the outer variable, but this can be over-ridden using the syntax ''$varName as $propName''. This also allows the same local variable to be captured as the initial value for more than one property. For example:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
$anon = new class use ($foo as $one, $bar as $two, $bar as $three) {};
</code>

Is equivalent to:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
$anon = new class($foo, $bar, $bar) {
    var $one;
    var $two;
    vat $three;
    
    public function __construct($one, $two, $three) {
        $this->one = $one;
        $this->two = $two;
        $this->three = $three;
    }
};
</code>

==== Modifiers and Type ====

The ''as'' keyword can also be used to modify the visibility and/or type of the declared property, either instead of or as well as renaming the property.

The modifiers allowed are the same as for Constructor Property Promotion, which is used internally to declare the properties; that is currently:

  * One of ''public'', ''protected'', or ''private''
  * Optional ''readonly'', which must be combined with a type specification
  * A type specification

For example:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
$anon = new class use ($foo as private, $bar as protected readonly int, $bar as ?int $alsoBar) {};
</code>

Is equivalent to:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
$anon = new class($foo, $bar, $bar) {
    private $foo;
    protected readonly int $bar;
    var ?int $alsoBar;
    
    public function __construct($foo, $bar, $alsoBar) {
        $this->foo = $foo;
        $this->bar = $bar;
        $this->alsoBar = $alsoBar;
    }
};
</code>

==== Capture by Reference ====

It is possible to capture a variable by reference, by prefixing it with <php>&</php>. For example:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$anon = new class use (&$foo as $fooProp) {};
$foo = 2;
echo $anon->fooProp;
</code>

Will print <php>2</php>. It is equivalent to:

<code php>
$foo = 1;
$anon = new class($foo) {
    var $one;
    
    public function __construct(&$one) {
        $this->one =& $one;
    }
};
$foo = 2;
echo $anon->fooProp;
</code>

===== Examples =====

**TODO**

===== Reflection =====

The constructor, its parameters, and the properties, all appear as normal if the anonymous class is reflected, but can be detected with two new methods:

  * ''ReflectionParameter::isCaptured(): bool''
  * ''ReflectionProperty::isCaptured(): bool''

Although internally they are declared using Constructor Property Promotion, the parameters and properties return ''false'' from ''ReflectionParameter::isPromoted'' and ''ReflectionProperty::isPromoted'', as they are not written that way by the user.

The generated constructor itself is not marked, partly due to implementation concerns that a limited number of bits remain available in the ''fn_flags'' bitmask.

===== Restrictions =====

Because it generates both property declarations and a constructor, the new syntax has a few restrictions, which are indicated with new Errors thrown by the compiler:

  * "Redefinition of captured property", e.g. <php>new class use($foo, $foo) {}</php> or <php>new class use($foo as $a, $bar as $a) {}</php>
  * "Captured property $a conflicts with existing property", e.g. <php>new class use($foo) { public $foo; }</php>
  * "Cannot declare custom constructor for anonymous class with captured properties", e.g. <php>new class use($foo) { public function __construct() {} }</php>
  * "Cannot pass constructor arguments to anonymous class with captured properties", e.g. <php>new class($foo) use($bar) {}</php>

==== Workarounds ====

The restrictions on custom constructors can be worked around by adding a normal instance method, and calling it immediately.

That is, given a current definition like this:

<code php>
$anon = new class($a, $b, $c) extends SomeOtherClass {
    private $a;
    public function __construct($a, $b, $c) {
        $this->a = $a;
        do_something($b);
        parent::__construct($c);
    }
};
</code>

You could instead write this:

<code php>
$anon = new class use($a) extends SomeOtherClass {
    public function init($b, $c) {
        do_something($b);
        parent::__construct($c);
    }
};
$anon->init($b, $c);
</code>

==== Alternative 1: Merging Constructors ====

It would be possible in principle to detect an existing constructor, and merge both its argument list and body with the generated code. That is, the above example could be written as:

<code php>
# NOT supported in current proposal
$anon = new class($b, $c) use($a) extends SomeOtherClass {
    public function __construct($b, $c) {
        do_something($b);
        parent::__construct($c);
    }
};
</code>

The principle difficulty here is finding a point in the compilation process where the explicit constructor can be easily detected but still modified.

It also leads to additional error conditions, which would give confusing errors if not specifically checked for:

  * If too few or too many parameters are passed in the ''new class(...)'' list, they would interact with the generated parameters for captured properties.
  * If the captured properties are added to the end of the parameter list, constructor parameters with default values would be disallowed.

==== Alternative 2: Automatically Calling Parent Constructor ====

Another suggestion is that any parameters passed to the ''new class'' statement could be automatically passed to the parent constructor; so this:

<code php>
# NOT supported in current proposal
$anon = new class($foo) use($bar) extends SomeOtherClass {};
</code>

would be equivalent to this:

<code php>
$anon = new class($foo, $bar) extends SomeOtherClass {
    var $bar;
    public function __construct($foo, $bar) {
        $this->bar = $bar;
        parent::__construct($foo);
    }
};
</code>

This seems to avoid the need to look up and manipulate the existing constructor definition, but discovering a parent constructor is actually even more difficult, as inheritance is only resolved after compilation. That leads to a few difficulties:

  * It would be possible for the parent class to have a constructor with an incompatible signature, or no constructor at all
  * The above example uses the input ''$foo'' to name the constructor parameter, but this could be any expression, e.g. <php>$anon = new class(42 + some_function()) use ($bar) extends SomeOtherClass {};</php>. As such, the parameters would actually have to use generated names of some sort.

Again, this leads to new error conditions which may be hard to understand to a user who doesn't know the details of the implementation.

It would also not be very consistent with the rest of the language, which neither generates nor requires calls to parent constructors.

==== Alternative 3: Generating a Different Method ====

Similar to the workaround above, the logic for setting captured property values could be generated in a method other than the constructor, e.g. ''%%__capture%%''. 

That is, compile <php>$anon = new class use ($foo) {};</php> to this:

<code php>
$anon = new class {
    var $foo;
    public function __capture($foo) {
        $this->foo = $foo;
    }
};
$anon->__capture($foo);
</code>

That would allow this:

<code php>
# NOT supported in current proposal
$anon = new class($b, $c) use($a) extends SomeOtherClass {
    public function __construct($b, $c) {
        do_something($b);
        parent::__construct($c);
    }
};
</code>

To be equivalent to this:

<code php>
$anon = new class($b, $c) extends SomeOtherClass {
    var $a;
    public function __construct($b, $c) {
        do_something($b);
        parent::__construct($c);
    }
    public function __capture($a) {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
};
$anon->__capture($a);
</code>

The main complexity here is generating the additional method call - in the above example, it is shown as called on the local variable ''$anon'', but in practice, it could happen anywhere in an expression, e.g. <php>some_function(new class($a) use($b) { ... });</php>.

==== Alternative 4: Calling an Additional Magic Method ====

Another variation would be to have the constructor generated as in the current implementation, but call out to another magic method for the user to define additional constructor behaviour, effectively:

<code php>
public function __construct($foo) {
    $this->foo = $foo;
    if ( method_exists($this, '__afterConstruct') ) {
        $this->__afterConstruct();
    }
}
</code>

If arguments are not supported, the advantage of this over existing workarounds is very slight. If they are supported, it would run into many of the same difficulties outlined in previous sections.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None. The new syntax is not currently valid PHP, and the behaviour of existing anonymous class declarations is unchanged.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 8.x (hopefully 8.3)

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Existing Extensions ====

Extensions manipulating the AST may encounter the new node kinds ''ZEND_AST_PROP_CAPTURE_LIST'' and ''ZEND_AST_PROP_CAPTURE'', representing the list of properties and constructor parameters which are generated in the compiler.

==== To Opcache ====
None anticipated, but expert review on this point would be welcomed.

===== Unaffected Functionality =====

All existing features of anonymous classes are retained, and can be combined with the new ''use'' clause, apart from the restrictions mentioned above. That includes:

  * Inheriting parent classes
  * Implementing interfaces
  * Using traits
  * Implementing any method other than ''%%__construct%%''
  * Declaring the entire class ''readonly''

===== Future Scope =====

==== Arbitrary Expressions ====

**TODO**

==== Extension to Anonymous Functions ====

**TODO**

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Add property capture to anonymous classes, with the syntax and semantics proposed, in PHP 8.3 (Yes / No, two-thirds majority required for acceptance)
