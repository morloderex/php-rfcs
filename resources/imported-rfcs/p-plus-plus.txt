===== Introduction =====
There are continuous arguments whether the PHP project should do everything to preserve backwards compatibility, or continue to add features to make PHP a more modern language, with as an example enhanced stricter type-safety.

Several suggestions have been made to address this perceived split. One of them is creating a newly branded "P++" to put all the new features into, and perhaps go the more "strict way", while continuing to maintain "PHP" without making this original version change at all. As it takes time, attention, and resources, to see whether such a direction is feasible, it makes sense to find out whether the general internals community thinks it is a worthwhile endeavour.

===== Proposal =====
The proposal in this RFC is a simple poll to see whether "P++" (supporting two distinct languages with different dynamic vs. strict handling) is a direction that people want to commit to spending the projectâ€™s time and energy to explore.
