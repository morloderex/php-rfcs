====== PHP RFC: Static "use function" ======

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes an extension to the ''use function'' statement, providing a means of aliasing ''public static'' functions from classes as file-local functions.

At present, functions cannot be autoloaded - as a consequence, developers have been forced to either preload all functions (not knowing if they get called or not) - or put them in (abstract) classes as ''public static'' functions (the more popular approach in Composer packages) and qualify every call with a class-name (or alias.)

While [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/function_autoloading|function autoloading]] has been proposed to address this issue, this RFC has been stalled several times due to problems with name-resolution, to which no good solution has been proposed.

This RFC offers an arguably much simpler solution to the problem, by allowing the use of classes as "pseudo-namespaces", which would immediately work with existing libraries of public static functions, and additionally would work with Composer (or any auto-loader) as-is.

Furthermore, existing classes with ''public static'' functions would be immediately supported without modification - e.g. without having to port all existing legacy code from ''public static'' to flat functions.
