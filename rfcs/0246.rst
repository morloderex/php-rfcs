:Title: Fix Base_convert() And Related PHP Lib Functions
:Author: Sara Golemon <pollita@php.net>

Introduction
------------

\_php_math_basetozval(), which underlies the base_convert(), bindec(),
octdec(), and hexdec() userspace functions, uses a custom parsing loop
which ignores any characters in the input string which aren't in the
[0-9a-zA-Z] set. This results in input strings containing garbage being
quietly processed as though they were valid numeric strings, for
example:

::

   base_convert(1.5, 10, 10); -> 15
   base_convert("&%^&%^#%#^%4#%#(%*!2#(%*", 10, 10); -> 42

Equally confusing, ordinals greater or equal to the base being converted
are also ignored:

::

   base_convert("12304560", 2, 10); -> 4

Proposal
--------

One of the following solutions:

-  A. Throw a Warning (or Notice) when unexpected characters are
   encountered, but continue as before
-  B. Throw a Warning and return FALSE on unexpected characters
-  C. Throw a Warning, stop processing, and return the value up to that
   point (strtol() behavior)
