:Title: Who Can Vote (2024)

Introduction
------------

The `original voting RFC <voting>`__ allowed two "audiences" to vote,
but because the original VCS account system has fallen out of use new
accounts are not being added there, and because the other audience of
voters was simply left as "chosen by those with php.net VCS accounts" it
has been not historically been a real avenue for people to obtain the
ability to vote on RFCs.

Proposal
--------

This RFC establishes a list of voters who will be allowed to vote on
future RFCs, and clearly define a process for new voters to be added,
voters to remove themselves, or voters to be removed.

It proposes only the mechanism for adding and removing members, it does
not seek to specify the criteria by which people are added or removed
and instead leaves that up to the voting membership to decide.

The initial active voter list will consist of all those who have voted
on any RFC between August 20, 2021 and August 20, 2024. (This is a list
of approximately 140 people.)

The initial emeritus voter list will consist of all of those having a
PHP VCS account prior to August 20, 2024. (This is a list of
approximately 1,650 people.)

Any active voter can nominate someone else to be an active voter. The
nomination must be seconded by another active voter. The nominee must
affirmatively accept their nomination.

Any emeritus voter can nominate themselves to be an active voter. This
requires no second.

At the end of each calendar month, a vote on all pending nominations (if
any) will be taken. The vote will be open for two weeks. If a quorum of
1/3 of active voters is reached, any nominee that receives a majority of
affirmative votes cast for their nomination will be added to the list of
active voters. (Voters may abstain from voting on a specific nominee, a
quorum is not required on the vote for each nominee, only across all
nominations.) If a quorum of voters has been reached and a nominee does
not receive a majority of affirmative votes, they will be deemed
ineligible for re-nomination for six months. If a quorum is not reached,
all nominations will be held over until the next round of voting.

Any active voter can request to be moved to the emeritus voter list at
any time.

Any active voter can nominate a voter to be removed from the active
and/or emeritus voter lists. This must be seconded by another active
voter. This nomination will require the affirmative vote a
super-majority (2/3) of the votes on that action.

At the beginning of each calendar year, those active voters who have not
voted on any RFC in the previous three calendar years will be
automatically moved to the emeritus voter list.

Implementation
--------------

In the future, different tools may be developed to manage the list of
voters, nominations, and voting, but the initial implementation will use
existing tools:

-  The lists of active and emeritus voters will be maintained within the
   wiki.php.net user system. The usernames will be public, additional
   information such as full names or contact information will be at the
   discretion of the voters.
-  Nominations will take place on the internals@lists.php.net mailing
   list.
-  Voting will take place using the wiki.php.net voting system with
   announcements about the opening of voting and results made to
   internals@lists.php.net.
