Introduction
------------

The PHP project has had a long-standing but unwritten, vague, and
inconsistently applied proscription against mentioning or using
third-party PHP projects on the grounds that it implies some sort of
endorsement over other third-party projects. This has impacted the web
projects (bugs.php.net, etc) and documentation in ways that seem harmful
to the overall PHP community.

Proposal
--------

Adopt this statement of principle:

   The web, documentation, infrastructure and any auxiliary projects
   within the PHP Project can use or document the existence of
   third-party PHP projects as part of their roles in supporting the
   overall PHP community. Such use does not represent endorsement of
   those third-party projects by the PHP Project.

Open Issues
-----------

-  None yet.

Future Scope
------------

-  None, except this guidance could be changed in the future by another
   RFC or subsequent governance mechanism.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

-  Adopt the statement of principle in this proposal? Yes/No
