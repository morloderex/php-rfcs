Count_elements Vs. Count()
==========================

:PHP-RFC: 0029
:Title: Count_elements Vs. Count()
:Author: Etienne Kneuss <colder@php.net>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2008-06-25
:PHP-Version: 5.3
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

An internal class has two ways to achieve a special feature:

::

    - implement the interface and define the method
    - define the handler

for a class to be userland-friendly AND fast it must:

::

    - define a zend_function pointer in the object for a specific method
    - when creating the object, check if the method is overriden, if so, assign that pointer to the child method
    - define a handler that will check that pointer, if defined: call it, if not, proceed without any method call

Proposal and Patch
------------------

There are one problem with how the count_elements handler is
defined/used: if an internal class extends Countable, it will call its
count() method regardless of the handler pointer.

There are two main reasons why it's a problem:

::

    - while it's userland friendly, it doesn't give the possibility of internals class to spare a method call if the method is not overriden.
    - it's not consistent with other handlers

The patch consists of changing the order of the checks to fix that
problem:

http://patches.colder.ch/php-src/array-1.454.patch?markup

Possible Breaks
---------------

Internal classes that define a count_elements handler will have to be
fixed.
