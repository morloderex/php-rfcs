Deprecate PHP Short Open Tags
=============================

:PHP-RFC: 0641
:Title: Deprecate PHP Short Open Tags
:Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
:Status: Superseded
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2019-03-20
:PHP-Version: 7.4
:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

PHP has provided over the years different ways to indicate the beginning
of PHP code other than the standard ``<?php ... ?>`` open tags. Most of
these opening tags have been removed with PHP 7.0.0 [1]_, however, PHP's
short open tags still remain.

Proposal
--------

Deprecate and disable ``short_open_tag`` in PHP 7.4 and remove PHP's
short open tags in PHP 8.0.

Reasoning
---------

-  The PHP
   `documentation <https://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php>`__
   discourages their usage.
-  PHP's short open tags clash with XML ``<?xml ?>`` and can mean two
   different things depending on the INI configuration.
-  PHP's short open tags depend on an INI directive and as such are
   non-portable.
-  As such source code may leak if PHP relying on the short open tags is
   executed on a configuration where this isn't enabled.
-  PHP's parser simplification.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

| Every script which currently uses the discouraged short ``<?`` open
  tag will need to convert to the standard ``<?php`` open tag.
| This can be automatically achieved by using the ``"full_opening_tag"``
  fixer from `PHP-CS-Fixer <https://cs.symfony.com/>`__.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

Deprecation notice and default value changed to Off in PHP 7.4 and
removal in PHP 8.0.

RFC Impact
----------

To SAPIs
~~~~~~~~

None.

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Readline and Tokenizer have been updated in the implementations patches.

To Opcache
~~~~~~~~~~

None to my understanding.

php.ini Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change ``short_open_tag`` from ``"1"`` to ``"0"``.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

The ``<?=`` short tag is unaffected because as of PHP 5.4 it is always
available.

Feedback
--------
