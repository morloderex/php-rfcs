However it could happen that a new major version is desired while the
active major version is still heavily used. Like what we had between php
4 and 5 or for the oldest, between php 3 and 4. We won't make more minor
release for the oldmajor, only bugfix micro/build releases until the
last oldmajor.minor gets EOLed.
