Introduction
------------

The only way to pass the default value to a function or method parameter
is to not pass anything. This can be particularly difficult in some
circumstances, because the language does not offer an intuitive way to
pass *nothing*. This RFC proposes to make the existing keyword,
``default``, the canonical way to pass the default value. Moreover,
``default`` becomes a valid expression in the function argument context,
meaning it can be creatively combined with any and all existing PHP
expression grammars to augment the default value as it is passed,
including assigning it to variables (see
`appendix <#appendixdefault_expressions>`__ for a comprehensive list).

In its simplest form, ``default`` can be used as a single token.

.. code:: php

   f(default)

However, this is of limited usefulness. The main benefit comes from
using ``default`` in expression contexts, the most common case being
**conditional expressions**.

.. code:: php

   function g($p = null) {
       f($p ?? default);
   }

In this example, function ``f`` will receive whatever its default value
is for its first argument only when ``$p`` is ``null``, otherwise it
receives the value of ``$p``.

Default as an expression
------------------------

The principal benefit of ``default`` is in its employ within
**expressions**. Consider the following example:

.. code:: php

   class Config {
       public function __construct(Theme $theme = new CuteTheme()) {}
   }

By default, the configuration is constructed with a new ``CuteTheme``.
We want to allow users to specify a different theme, but if they do not
specify anything, we should still use the default. For the purposes of
this example, ``Config`` should be considered third-party code we cannot
change. Given we want to conditionally apply the user's custom theme,
traditionally we have a few options here, none of them good:

#. Copy the current default from ``Config``. This should be considered
   an invalid option, because we want to allow the upstream library to
   change the default without having to update our code.
#. Filter and splat the theme argument.
#. Reflection.

.. code:: php

   // Filter and splat.
   function applyTheme(?string $theme = null) {
       return new Config(...array_filter([isset($theme) ? new $theme : null]));
   }

Filter and splat is a viable but unintuitive way to conditionally pass
*nothing* as an argument and only works if we're willing to sacrifice
``null`` as a placeholder for *nothing*. Moreover, it only works with a
single argument; as soon as two or more nullable arguments are involved,
collapsing them in this manner risks passing the arguments in the wrong
order.

.. code:: php

   // Reflect.
   function applyTheme(?string $theme = null) {
       $param = new ReflectionParameter(['Config', '__construct'], 'theme');
       return new Config(isset($theme) ? new $theme : $param->getDefaultValue());
   }

Reflection is a verbose option with performance overhead. It requires us
to duplicate the class and method name we're calling and be explicit
about the name or number of the argument, in order to obtain its default
value.

``default`` provides an elegant and intuitive solution to this problem.

.. code:: php

   // Conditional default.
   function applyTheme(?string $theme = null) {
       return new Config(isset($theme) ? new $theme : default);
   }

This is somewhat similar to reflection, but PHP knows which class,
method and argument we're calling just from context.

Default as a single token
-------------------------

Default as a single token was `proposed <skipparams>`__ a decade ago as
a mechanism for skipping some parameters, but was declined. Since then,
`named arguments <named_params>`__ has provided a way to implicitly pass
*nothing*, by skipping over parameters we don't want to pass. Named
arguments mostly preclude the usefulness of skipping parameters with
``default``, but a curious consequence of named arguments is parameter
names suddenly became part of our APIs. That is, changing parameter
names now constitutes a compatibility break, whether libraries want to
adopt this contract or not. Although it is neither the principal aim nor
benefit of this RFC, it does provide an alternative syntax for passing
defaults that does not rely on named arguments, and as such relinquishes
the burden on libraries to affirm parameter names part of their API.
That is, libraries could now elect to declare parameter names not part
of their backwards-compatibility promise by offering passing ``default``
as an alternative.

.. code:: php

   // Skipping JSON depth parameter with named parameters.
   json_decode($json, true, flags: JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);

   // Skipping JSON depth parameter with default.
   json_decode($json, true, default, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);

Proposal
--------

``default`` is now a valid expression, but only in argument-passing
contexts. In all other contexts it is invalid, save for those in which
it was valid previously, namely ``switch`` statements and ``match``
expressions. That is, ``default`` may be used when calling global or
namespaced functions, static or instance class methods (including
anonymous classes), any callable (including closures and arrow
functions), whether they are defined internally or in userland. Outside
these contexts, where expressions would otherwise be accepted,
attempting to use ``default`` will raise a compile-time error.

Attempting to pass ``default`` to a function with no parameters, or as
an argument beyond the callee's defined parameter limit, will result in
a runtime exception. Similarly, attempting to pass ``default`` to a
required parameter, with no default defined, results in a runtime
exception.

Named arguments and default expressions can be used together, as in the
following example.

.. code:: php

   $f = fn ($v = 1, $default = 2) => $default;
   var_dump($f(default: default + 1)); // int(3)

Internally, ``default`` is treated as a new opcode that causes the VM to
perform a parameter default value lookup using reflection. If this
lookup fails for any reason, a runtime exception will be thrown.
Currently the only known cause of failure is lookup of trampoline
functions, which can be created by calling ``__invoke`` on a closure, as
in ``(fn ($P = 1) => $P)->__invoke(default);``. Considering this is not
the intended, nor even a documented way of invoking a closure, it is
supposed this limitation is very minor.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None known.

Future Scope
------------

It may be possible to overcome the limitation regarding trampoline
functions. It is unclear whether there is a practical need to do so, but
if the need should arise, this should be possible to implement without
any BC break.

Voting
------

As per the `voting RFC <RFC/voting#required_majority>`__ a yes/no vote
with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.

Appendix: Default expressions
-----------------------------

Throughout this RFC we have referred to default as an *expression*, but
the only concrete examples of expressions have been the conditional
expressions using the null coalesce (``??``) and ternary (``?:``)
operators. This appendix lists all the ways ``default`` can be combined
with other tokens and operators to form valid expressions, but before
getting to that list, let's look at one more non-conditional example
using the binary pipe operator (``|``) to augment flags.

.. code:: php

   class Json {
       static function encode(mixed $value, int $flags = JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR): string
       {
           return json_encode($value, $flags);
       }
   }

This static class wraps the internal function, ``json_encode`` to
provide saner defaults for JSON encoding. In particular, it sets the
``JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR`` flag so our return type is guaranteed to be
string, eliminating the possibility we have to deal with ``false`` as a
return type. For the purposes of this contrived example, it is required
to ignore the fact that the flag should be specified in the function
body rather than the parameter default, to ensure the caller doesn't
break this contract. Supposing we want to pretty-print our encoded JSON,
we could call: ``Json::encode([], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);`` However, this
will override the throw on error flag, which we want to keep. Calling
the function as: ``Json::encode([], default | JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);``
allows us to keep the default and append our pretty-print flag, which
continues to work even if the ``Json`` class should elect to update its
defaults later.

Following is the full expression list involving ``default``. Not all of
these examples will make much (or any) sense in practical terms,
particularly those towards the end of the list, but many may have uses
depending on your requirements and creativity.

Special thanks
--------------

The implementation for this feature was heavily subsidised by invaluable
input from Ilija and Bob Weinand. In particular, Ilija assessed the
feasibility and guided the implementation path, and Bob submitted the
entire Bison grammar patch! Without them, this feature would either have
been impossible or highly scuffed. They, along with everyone else whom
supported me from R11, have my utmost thanks! ❤
