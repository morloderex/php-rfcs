Introduction
------------

Currently setLocation() returns old location when called, but if new one
is not provided it will unset location property.Adding a getLocation is
a practical way of getting current location from client. It would be a
convenient way to get location where next request will go directly from
client instead of pulling that data from elsewhere, especially if
location can change, for example when there is a fallback mechanism
around SoapClient.

Proposal
--------

Adding getLocation method to a SoapClient:

.. code:: php

   $client = new SoapClient('http://example.com/some.wsdl');
   $location = $client->__getLocation();

Backward Incompatible Changes
