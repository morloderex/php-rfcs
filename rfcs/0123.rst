Introduction
------------

strncmp doesn't supporting negative length:

.. code:: php

   <?php
      if (strncmp("prefix_num", "num", -3) === 0) {
           echo "they have same suffix\n";
      }
   ?> 

running the above script in PHP 5.3.6 will result:

::

   warning: Length must be greater than or equal to 0 in /tmp/1.php 

We need to write some codes like following one to make it works as
expect:

.. code:: php

   <?php
      if (strncmp(substr("prefix_num", -3, 3), "num", 3) === 0) {
           echo "they have same suffix\n";
      }
   ?> 

Proposal
--------

base on feature request: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=36944 , I wrote
a patch to make strn(case)cmp supporting negative length,

after patched, following script:

.. code:: php

   <?php
      if (strncmp("prefix_num", "num", -3) === 0) {
           echo "they have same suffix\n";
      }
   ?> 

will work as expect.

and if the abs of the negative length is greater than any strlen of the
first two parameters, then strn(case)cmp will work as strncmp in the
reverse order with the abs value:

.. code:: php

   <?php
   var_dump(strncmp("prefix_num", "num", -10));
   var_dump(strncmp("mun_xiferp", "mun", 10));
   /** output:
   int(7)
   int(7)
   */
   ?> 

BC Breaks
---------

::

    * Any strncmp call with a computed length which may end up being negative will now potentially return a match where it wouldn't before.
