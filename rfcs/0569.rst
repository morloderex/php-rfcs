:Title: Raise Warnings For Json_encode() And Json_decode() Issues
:Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
:Status: Withdrawn

Introduction
------------

Whenever ``json_encode()`` or ``json_decode()`` are called, you *must*
call ``json_last_error()`` to check if a failure occurred.

This is unnecessarily complicated and is easy to be forgotten leading to
bugs in code. Particular with new developers that aren't familiar with
error handling techniques.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes changing ``json_encode()`` and ``json_decode()`` to
raise E_WARNING whenever a failure occurs.

Concerns
--------

The functionality of ``json_last_error()`` and ``json_last_error_msg()``
are unaffected and they can still be used in exactly the same way they
are today.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

Existing code that is using ``json_last_error()`` for error handling may
need changing to handle the E_WARNING instead.

However it is expected that most code is either suppressing warnings, or
converting them to exceptions with an exception handler.

It's also worth noting that ``json_decode()`` already has 2 instances it
raises E_WARNING.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.3

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires
50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'.
