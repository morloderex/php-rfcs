Introduction
------------

Allow use AS in the closure declaration, like:

::

   <?php
     $foo = "bar";
     
     $func = function () use ($foo as $dup, &$foo as $ref) { //alias name
     };
     

Proposal
--------

I have made a patch, after patch, the following script:

::

   <?php

   $a = "2";

   $b = function() use (&$a as $b, $a as $c, $a as $e) {
       echo $b;
       echo $c;
       echo $e;
       $b = 4;
   };

   $b();

   echo $a;

   class Foo {
       public function closure() {
           return function () use ($this as $obj) {
               var_dump($obj);
           };
       }
   }

   $foo = new Foo();

   $a = $foo->closure();
   $a();

will output:

::

   2224object(Foo)#2 (0) {
   }

I will be keeping improve this patch.
