Non-capturing Catches
=====================

:PHP-RFC: 0714
:Title: Non-capturing Catches
:Author: Max Semenik <maxsem.wiki@gmail.com>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2020-04-05
:PHP-Version: 8.0
:Version: 0.9

Introduction
------------

Currently, PHP requires to capture the exception being caught to a
variable:

.. code:: php

   try {
       foo();
   } catch (SomeException $ex) {
       die($ex->getMessage());
   }

However, you need to specify the variable even if it's not used:

.. code:: php

   try {
       changeImportantData();
   } catch (PermissionException $ex) {
       echo "You don't have permission to do this";
   }

Someone reading the above code is left to wonder if the author intended
to not use the exception variable or it's a bug.

Proposal
--------

Allow catching exceptions without capturing them to variables:

.. code:: php

   try {
       changeImportantData();
   } catch (PermissionException) { // The intention is clear: exception details are irrelevant
       echo "You don't have permission to do this";
   }

Prior art
---------

Such change was first proposed in `this
RFC <https://wiki.php.net/rfc/anonymous_catch>`__ 7 years ago. It was
turned down mostly because it also wanted to allow blanket catches like
this:

.. code:: php

   try {
       foo();
   } catch {
       bar();
   }

Meanwhile what I'm proposing here has received mostly positive feedback
so I feel it's worth revisiting.
