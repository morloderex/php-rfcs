Introduction
------------

There are continuous arguments whether the PHP project should do
everything to preserve backwards compatibility, or continue to add
features to make PHP a more modern language, with as an example enhanced
stricter type-safety.

Several suggestions have been made to address this perceived split. One
of them is creating a newly branded "P++" to put all the new features
into, and perhaps go the more "strict way", while continuing to maintain
"PHP" without making this original version change at all. As it takes
time, attention, and resources, to see whether such a direction is
feasible, it makes sense to find out whether the general internals
community thinks it is a worthwhile endeavour.

Proposal
--------

The proposal in this RFC is a simple poll to see whether "P++"
(supporting two distinct languages with different dynamic vs. strict
handling) is a direction that people want to commit to spending the
projectâ€™s time and energy to explore.
