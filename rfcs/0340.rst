Introduction
------------

There is going to be a new major release of PHP, `PHP 7 </rfc/php6>`__,
and we have agreed on a `timeline </rfc/php7timeline>`__ for it. Because
it is a major release that breaks backwards-compatibility in some areas,
there have been calls to create a final minor release for the PHP 5.x
line, PHP 5.7. Such a release would ease the transition from PHP 5 to
PHP 7. Firstly, it would give users an extra year of official support
for PHP 5. Secondly, it would allow us to add deprecation notices and
pre-reserve keywords for things that will change or be added in PHP 7,
in order to give users a chance to update their code.

Proposal
--------

A final minor version of PHP 5 shall be made, PHP 5.7. Its feature
freeze should coincide with that of PHP 7, however it will be released
earlier (a year after the release of PHP 5.6, per the normal `Release
Process </rfc/releaseprocess>`__), in August 2015:

Unlike normal PHP minor versions, no new features may be added to the
PHP 5.7 release - any new features must go into PHP 7 instead. However,
RFCs targeting PHP 7 may choose to add deprecation notices or other
warnings to PHP 5.7, and pre-reserve new reserved words that will be
used by PHP 7 features. Bug fixes will be allowed as usual.
