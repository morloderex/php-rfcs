DateTimeInterface Removal
=========================

:PHP-RFC: 0406
:Title: DateTimeInterface Removal
:Author: Marco Pivetta <ocramius@gmail.com>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Unknown
:Created: 2015-07-21
:Version: 0.1

The \\DateTimeInterface is an implementation detail of ext/date that
should not have been exposed to userland code. The reason for it to be
an internal detail is that ext/date does NOT rely on the interface
itself, but on internal state of the \\DateTime and \\DateTimeImmutable
implementations, as explained in `Pull request
#512 <https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/512>`__ and `Bug
#65768 <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=65768>`__.

Because of the internal ext/date interactions, PHP 5.5.8 introduced a
major BC break by making it `impossible to implement \\DateTimeInterface
in userland <http://3v4l.org/8GvgO>`__.

This sort of behavior is what may become yet another of those quirks in
the language that depreciate PHP.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes its removal from PHP 7.0.0 even though it represents a
BC break.

Alternatives
------------

An alternative solution to the currently standing issue is to make
ext/date rely on the interface internally, and therefore actually fix
`Bug #65768 <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=65768>`__. There may not be
enough time to do that, though, which is why this proposal is being
advanced, rather than a more "elaborate" fix.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

Applications relying on \\DateTimeInterface would need to explicitly
switch back to checking against \\DateTime and \\DateTimeImmutable.

Software compatible with PHP 5.5.0~5.5.7 and implementing
\\DateTimeInterface would break anyway. Software checking against
\\DateTimeInterface via instanceof.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.0.0 List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be
included in. Use relative versions such as "next PHP 5.x" or "next PHP
5.x.y".

RFC Impact
----------

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ext/session

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

2/3 majority due to major BC break involvement.

Patches and Tests
-----------------

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether
a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just
a prototype.

Implementation
--------------

None, so far. Joe Watkins told me that he has a patch for it.
