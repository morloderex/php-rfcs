Magical Quotes In PHP

Introduction
------------

This has been discussed a few times, with mixed results, so here is a
proposal that deals with Magical Quotes starting with PHP 5.3.0. The
purpose of this RFC is to safely deprecate the use of magical quotes as
of PHP 5.3.0, and remove as of PHP 6.0.0.

Common Misconceptions
---------------------

All here agree that magic quotes is not the best solution to any
problem, and that people should stop using them. However, people use
them. And other people simply leave them on. And even others check for
them.

Getting versus Setting
----------------------

A key distinction exists between getting and setting magic quotes. The
getting should remain as okay, whereas the setting should be deprecated,
yelled at, and removed. This is an important distinction to realize when
evaluating this topic.

Getting remains
---------------

So when speaking of E_DEPRECATED and the removal of magic quotes, we
speak of the setting and not the getting of said setting. So to be
clear, the following code should work in PHP 6 by emitting zero errors:

.. code:: php

   <?php 
       get_magic_quotes_gpc();     // returns false
       get_magic_quotes_runtime(); // returns false
   ?>

Setting is removed
------------------

The following code is to emit an E_DEPRECATED error as of PHP 5.3.0, and
the function removed (fatal error) as of PHP 6.0.0:

.. code:: php

   <?php 
       set_magic_quotes_runtime(); // bad
   ?>

Also, as currently done, setting magic quotes via the directive (like in
php.ini) to *on* should produce a fatal error in PHP 6, but continue to
do nothing if set to *off*. In PHP 5.3 this is to produce an
*E_DEPRECATED* when set to *on*, but do nothing when setting to *off*.

Required changes from today
---------------------------

-  Remove E_DEPRECATED warnings from the 5.3 branch for get_\*
-  Restore get_\* functions to PHP 6, and return false

Why do this?
------------

Because programmers enjoy writing portable version friendly code, and
have done so for many years both past, present, and future. The idea
presented in this RFC is the original decision[1], and as such is still
mentioned in NEWS[2] today.

Questions
---------

The main concern with this RFC is how we default magic_quotes_gpc to On
in PHP 5.2 but suddenly set it to off with an E_DEPRECATED error in PHP
5.3. If this remains then an extremely strong education effort must be
executed.
