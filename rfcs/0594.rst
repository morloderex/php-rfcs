Introduction
------------

The backtick operator (:literal:`\`dir D:\foo\``) is used to execute
commands via shell.

The same functionality is also available as ``shell_exec()``.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes to deprecate (E_DEPRECATED) it in PHP 7.3 and suggest
to use ``shell_exec()`` instead:

-  in case PHP decided in future to use backtick enclosed strings for
   Unicode strings
-  because it is a shady way to execute a rare and dangerous operation
-  because it is weirdly specific to a rare operation; regexp literals,
   xml-strings literals are way more common use cases, but they don't
   have a specific string literal

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None, the feature will continue to work until it is removed in future
PHP versions, but a notice will be emitted.

Proposed PHP Version:
---------------------

7.3

Voting
------

2/3 majority will be required.
