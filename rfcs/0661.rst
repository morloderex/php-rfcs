Proposal
--------

| Each extension is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority to be
  unbundled otherwise the PHP Project is named as a maintainer for the
  extension until the next call for Maintainers.
| The number of bugs for each extension is accurate at the time of
  writing (2019-07-16)
