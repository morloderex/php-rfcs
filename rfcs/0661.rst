Introduction
------------

The RFC proposes to unbundle or assign the PHP Project as a maintainer
for the listed extension in PHP 8 following the `Cleaning up
unmaintained extensions RFC </rfc/umaintained_extensions>`__.

Information about extension maintenance status is based on the
EXTENSIONS file [1]_ located at the root of php-src.

The following list provides a short overview of the extensions currently
unmaintained.

Proposal
--------

| Each extension is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority to be
  unbundled otherwise the PHP Project is named as a maintainer for the
  extension until the next call for Maintainers.
| The number of bugs for each extension is accurate at the time of
  writing (2019-07-16)
