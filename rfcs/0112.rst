Callable Type Hint
==================

:PHP-RFC: 0112
:Title: Callable Type Hint
:Author: Hannes Magnusson <bjori@php.net>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2011-06-07

:Version: 1.0

The problem
-----------

Frameworks have started to adopt Closures for callbacks, utilizing the
'Closure' typehint. That has an unfortunate sideeffect of requiring
already-existing-methods to be wrapped into a closure calling that
method. Additionally, the PHP documentation on closures indicates that
the "Closure" class is considered an implementation detail, and may be
subject to change in the future -- which means that typehinting on
Closure may break in the future.

The solution
------------

Introducing a callable typehint.

The typehint would allow a string with a function name, an array
composed of classname/obj+methodname, and a closure.

Callable vs Callback
--------------------

callback is callable, the opposite could not be true. A string, or a
closure, is callable, but the string is not a callback.

The documentations already use \`array\` hinting when a function expects
an array, even though it does not type hint on it. The documentations
already use \`callable\` hiting when a function expects a callable
instance, even though it does not type hint on it.

Furthermore we already have a function called is_callable(), and this
new feature will share its implementation.

Introducing a different name (i..e callback) will therefore only create
more inconsistencies and confusion.

The callable typehint reuses the is_callable() logic.

Initialization
--------------

Only null initialize is allowed, making it consistent with classname
typehinting.

Discussion summary
''''''''''''''''''

-  The only arguments against the idea came from Stas, `making the
   argument <http://php.markmail.org/message/hhdjdfo3o34mcj2t?q=callable>`__;

   -  'callable' is a data structure not unlike 'balanced binary tree'
      and 'readable file', and none of them make sense have as a part of
      the language syntax. They belong in userspace.
   -  A "strict typing error" is hard to handle in user-space
      gracefully.

-  Everyone else seem to like the idea, so far.
-  As for the patch itself, Felipe pointed out that the patch is missing
   an method in ext/reflection to retrieve the typehint information.
-  Things to finalize:

   -  Reflection support
   -  Arginfo support

Changelog

-  June 7th 2011, Initial writeup
-  July 27th 2011, Added "callable vs callback" and "initialization"
