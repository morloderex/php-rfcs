Introduction
------------

Currently, a negative max execution time may be set to a negative number
without warning or error. The documentation does not define what happens
when a negative number is given, and this RFC deprecates passing a
negative number.

Proposal
--------

Given a max_execution_time either via a php.ini setting or via
set_time_limit() will result in a deprecation notice from 8.4+ and a
fatal error in 9.0+. Numbers greater than 999,999,999 (31 years, 259
days) will be set to 0 (unlimited).

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

\* Legacy code passing a negative number will receive a deprecation
notice.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

8.4: deprecation notice 9.0: fatal error

RFC Impact
----------

To SAPIs
~~~~~~~~

The potential of a fatal error while applying the configuration.

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None

To Opcache
~~~~~~~~~~

None

Open Issues
-----------

Not yet.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

No change for positive integers in the bounds.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

\* yes: to apply a deprecation warning and fatal error in the next major
version \* no: to keep it undefined
