Introduction
------------

The purpose of this feature is to create the most random number/string
possible, and have it work on every system. The API is still
undetermined.

This will attempt several methods until eventually finding one that's
available to the system. It should always work.

Notes related to this idea
--------------------------

-  Determine an order (most to least random)
-  User should have an option to choose: preferred type(s), dictionary
   of returned characters, ...
-  This might interface with session entropy, and be exposed for several
   internal uses
-  It should report which randomness method was used
-  `functiongetentropy </rfc/functiongetentropy>`__ - This RFC about
   getEntropy() directly relates to this

Sources of randomness
---------------------

From all systems:

-  rand_pseudo_bytes() (if openssl is enabled)

Linux and related friends:

-  /dev/random, /dev/urandom, /dev/arandom

Windows:

-  COM('CAPICOM.Utilities.1')->getrandom()

Fallbacks:

-  Various system specific resources, which may include: stat, free disk
   space and time
-  mt_rand
-  rand

Optionals as per users desire and setup:

-  EGD

API
---

Still under review. Probably a simple function (get_random_string())
and/or a more feature rich class.

TODO
----

-  Research how other (languages) do it, and probably steal their ideals
-  Talk to cryptology geeks
