Introduction
------------

Most binary expressions in PHP (e.g. \`$x = $y op $z;`) have a shorthand
form for self assignment (where the lefthand of the binary op is the
same as the lefthand of the assignment), in this example: \`$x = $x op
$y;\` is the same as \`$x op= $y;`. While it's true for most binary
operations, it is not true for the null coalesce operator (the subject
of http://wiki.php.net/rfc/null_coalesce_equal_operator ) or the short
ternary operator: \`?:`.

Proposal
--------

Add an assignment operatory for short ternary expressions such that the
following two lines of code are equivalent:

.. code:: php

   $x = $x ?: $y;
   $x ?:= $y;

Thus, the value of right-hand parameter is assigned by value to the
left-hand variable if the left-hand variable is currently falsy.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

This proposed for the next PHP 7.x.

Vote
----

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. A straight
Yes/No vote is being held.

Question: Approve Short Ternary Assignment Operator RFC and merge oatch into master?

Voting Choices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Yes
-  No

On 2016-03-24 vote was closed a few hours after opening (at 9:3 in
favor) due to issues with the proposed implementation. It will be
reopened at a later time (with a fresh vote).

References
----------

This is essentially the same proposal as
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null_coalesce_equal_operator with a focus on
the short ternary operator, rather than the null coalesce operator.
