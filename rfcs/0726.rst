Unbundle Ext/xmlrpc
===================

:PHP-RFC: 0726
:Title: Unbundle Ext/xmlrpc
:Author: Christoph M. Becker <cmb@php.net>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2020-05-12
:PHP-Version: 8.0
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

ext/xmlrpc relies on on
`libxmlrpc-epi <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlrpc-epi/>`__, which
is abandoned. Even worse, we are bundling a modified
`0.51 <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/77ee4e63a61e884d393713fa822df043eec6c87b/ext/xmlrpc/libxmlrpc/xmlrpc.h#L47>`__,
while the latest version is
`0.54.1 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlrpc-epi/files/xmlrpc-epi-base/>`__.
This is exacerbated by the fact that the system library is usually built
against libexpat, but the bundled library is likely to be built against
libxml2 using our compatibility layer.

Relying on an external library which is no longer maintained for more
than nine years is suboptimal. Dropping support for system libraries in
favor of the bundled xmlrpc-epi, however, would obviously require us to
update the bundled library to the latest version, and also to maintain
it ourselves for the foreseeable future at least. Since ext/xmlrpc
appears barely maintained for years, it does not seem likely that we
would have the resources to actually do that.

Proposal
--------

Unbundle ext/xmlrpc (i.e. move it to PECL) without any explicit
deprecation.

We are not doing users a favor by having an extension which relies on an
unmaintained library, which may have serious issues and maybe even
vulnerabilites, without signalling that issue. Since the problem with
xmlrpc does not appear to be its functionality or API, but rather the
lack of maintainance, a deprecation does not seem appropriate. Moving
the extension to PECL is supposed to give users that signal, so they can
reevaluate their use of the extension.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

The functionality offered by the xmprc extension is no longer available,
unless the respective PECL package is used.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 8.0.0.

Future Scope
------------

It may be considered to move the ``xmlrpc_errors`` and
``xmlrpc_error_number`` INI settings to the xmlrpc extension. This is
outside of the scope of this RFC, though.

Voting
------

A simple yes/no vote about whether to unbundle ext/xmlrpc or not.
Unbundling requires a 2/3 majority. Voting starts on 2020-05-12, and
ends on 2020-05-26 (12:00 UTC).
