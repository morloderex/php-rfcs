Default User-Agent For CURL
===========================

:PHP-RFC: 0825
:Title: Default User-Agent For CURL
:Author: Michael Maroszek <maroszek@gmx.net>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2021-06-25
:PHP-Version: 8.2
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

PHP has a user_agent php.ini entry for decades, which can be set as a
default value. But it is considered for stream based operations like
file_get_contents. This RFC proposes a new curl.user_agent php.ini entry
which would allow setting a default user_agent for all cURL request.
This would benefit in better consistency for setting a default
user_agent. This feature will mainly be used in a SAPI context in my
use-case, which i will illustrate later.

Proposal
--------

Add a new php.ini entry for cURL named curl.user_agent, which will set
the default User-Agent HTTP Header for all cURL related requests. Of
course anyone can override the default value using curl_setopt.

An alternative approach would be to reuse the existing (global)
user_agent ini setting also for cURL, but this would touch backwards
compatibility, which isn't favorable.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

8.1

RFC Impact
----------

To SAPIs
~~~~~~~~

This feature is especially useful for SAPI usage, as it allows a default
header for all HTTP requests (independently if stream based or cURL
based) that will allow the remote side to detect the application. At the
moment you need to have a workflow or a wrapper that will ensure that
the User-Agent is set for all streams and cURL requests. In our use-case
the user is also allowed to create PHP scripts by himself. In this
situation the user will most probably not set the User-Agent at all, but
rely on the defaults.

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No impact. By default the new entry is empty and will not do anything.

To Opcache
~~~~~~~~~~

No impact.

New Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No

php.ini Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

curl.user_agent is unset by default for development and production.

Open Issues
-----------

Discussion if the ini visibility should be PHP_INI_ALL or PHP_INI_SYSTEM
https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/6834/files#r628774432

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

This feature does not affect PHP very much and there does not collide
with any currently proposed RFCs.

Future Scope
------------

This RFC does not have any future scope.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

At the moment the php.ini option is proposed inside the curl section. If
the discussion should not end unanimously we should consider adding a
voting option if the curl section or the global section should be
targeted for the user_agent entry.

Patches and Tests

Tests are included in the following PR.
