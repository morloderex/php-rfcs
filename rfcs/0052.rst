Automatic Get/set Methods For Objects

:Title: Automatic Get/set Methods For Objects
:Author: Michael Kimsal <michael@kimsal.com>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Unknown
:Created: 2008-12-16
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

Currently, PHP only allows for defining functionality during access to
properties on an object when those properties are not defined in the
class. This proposal will outline a suggested change to PHP's behaviour
when dealing with object properties which will allow for compact code
when necessary, and easy refactoring of code when necessary with a
minimum of fuss.

Proposal version 1
------------------

When a class is initialized at runtime, each property will have a 'get'
and a 'set' method created for it which will handle basic 'get/set'
functionality. If a get or set method exists for the given property,
then the corresponding auto-generated method would not be
auto-generated.

Proposal version 2
------------------

When a property on an object is attempted to be read, the PHP engine
will look for a corresponding getXXX() method for the given property. If
one exists, that methods will be executed. If not, the property will be
returned (subject the public/protected/private visibility). Similarly,
when a property on an object is attempted to be set, the PHP engine will
look for a corresponding setXXX() method. If one exists, that method
will be executed. Otherwise, the property will be set normally (subject
to public/protected/private visibility).

Benefits
--------

This will allow for standard PHP code with property access logic to be
written without the need for writing corresponding boilerplate get/set
methods up front. Only when non-standard or extra logic needs to be
applied to a property during reading or writing would get/set methods
for those properties need to be written. This will reduce code size and
make it more clear that 'out of the ordinary' logic is happening in the
given code.

Also, when dealing with existing classes that are not written with
traditional get/set methods for each property, this proposed change
would make it easier to add in new functionality without the need for
extensive refactoring of code that's using the classes in question. For
example, rather than needing to update code such as $calendar->dayOfWeek
to be $calendar->getDayOfWeek() in the calling code, the code using the
calendar library can remain untouched, and a getDayOfWeek() method can
be added to the calendar class, introducing some extra functionality in
the calculation of the day of the week (in this example).

Changelog
---------

Initial draft. Full idea not fleshed out entirely with code examples
yet.
