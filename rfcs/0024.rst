Introduction
------------

This RFC aims to clarify the situation with call-time pass-by-ref in PHP
5.3.

History
-------

Before PHP 4.0 was released, ``allow_call_time_pass_reference`` was
introduced as a means of retaining back compatibility with PHP 3, at the
point where returning by reference from a function declaration became
possible [1]. By default, the INI switch has been On since inception
[2]. The warning (formerly ``E_COMPILE_WARNING`` but currently
``E_DEPRECATED``) is only thrown if the INI switch is Off. You therefore
need to **explicitly** switch off the directive in order to discover
that the behaviour is deprecated.

At the time ``allow_call_time_pass_reference`` was introduced,
php.ini-recommended was interestingly referred to as
'php.ini-optimized'. Over the years, it has become fairly standard to
regard php.ini-recommended as 'production settings'; things like
``display_errors=Off`` and ``log_errors=On`` have helped this perception
along. From inception, ``allow_call_time_pass_reference`` was switched
``Off`` in php.ini-recommended but ``On`` in php.ini-dist and by
default. For the last 8 years, therefore, the first anyone is likely to
have known about their code being less than kosher is when it went live.

Even in the current php.ini-recommended, the switch is attributed only
to 'Code cleanliness'. The full entry in the heading about changed
settings reads:

::

   ; - allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off     [Code cleanliness]
   ;     It's not possible to decide to force a variable to be passed by reference
   ;     when calling a function.  The PHP 4 [sic] style to do this is by making the
   ;     function require the relevant argument by reference.

In fact, allowing values to be passed by reference is the default
behaviour in PHP, and has been from PHP 4.0 beta right up to PHP 5.3.

Reality Check
-------------

In some circumstances, on some platforms, passing values by reference
can actually speed up your code. In most cases, though - and for all
when it comes to large arrays - it carries a performance penalty. If you
make use of by-ref for performance reasons on a given platform, that
optimization will not be portable.

Future
------

The directive is completely gone from CVS HEAD [3]. The effect of this
originally was that a new-to-many ``E_STRICT`` would be thrown when
values are passed by reference. However, it's been moved to
``E_DEPRECATED`` recently. In either case, it will no longer be possible
to turn the warning off.

Proposal
--------

Switch ``allow_call_time_pass_reference`` off by default in PHP_5_3
branch. At present there is no warning when running PHP under default
settings, whereas in PHP 6 there will be a 'deprecated' warning given
and no means of turning it off.

Comments
~~~~~~~~

currently allow_call_time_pass_reference is set to Off in both
php.ini-production and php.ini-development for 5.3, and Call-time
pass-by-reference was removed from 5.4, so this RFC is
implemented/obsolete.
