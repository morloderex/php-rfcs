:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

Currently we don't have a explicitly defined and agreed upon process for
introducing small self contained features. This RFC tries to address the
common questions: 1, What do we consider to be a small, self-contained
feature? 2, Do we need to have an RFC and vote even for the smalles
features? 3, What version should the small features target?
