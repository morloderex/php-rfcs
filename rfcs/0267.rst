Add Session_gc()
================

:Title: Add Session_gc()
:Author: Yasuo Ohgaki <yohgaki@ohgaki.net>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2023-08-22
:PHP-Version: 7.1
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

Current session GC depends on probability. Thus, low traffic sites would
not delete expired session data and could be usable as valid session.
Traffic varies day and night time for high traffic sites. Chances are
high that expired session may not be deleted as it should.

The best way to purge old session data is executing GC periodically.

Although timestamp based session management is declined twice, it is
mandatory for session management. Please refer to Strict Session RFC for
details.

Proposal
--------

-  Add session_gc() API.
-  Document calling session_gc() periodically is the best practice.

::

   int session_gc(void)

It simply executes GC save handler defined.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.2
