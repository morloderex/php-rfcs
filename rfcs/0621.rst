Making StdClass Iterable
========================

:PHP-RFC: 0621
:Title: Making StdClass Iterable
:Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
:Status: Declined
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2019-01-12
:PHP-Version: 7.4

Introduction
------------

By far the most common usage of ``stdClass`` is (as the
`manual <http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.classes.php>`__ defines)
"Created by typecasting to object", or from the result of a call to
'json_decode()' using the default parameters. In both of these scenarios
the resulting object is analogous to a plain array. Although it is a
class, it has no methods or private/protected properties, it is simply
an array that uses a different syntax for accessing its elements.

However the ``iterable`` type (introduced in PHP 7.1) does not accept
this object, despite accepting the virtually identical array it was born
from.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes that ``stdClass`` is changed to implement the
``Traversable`` interface so that code using the ``iterable`` type can
accept/return these objects.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

This RFC aims to be fully backward compatible, although the
implementation of the iteration will likely change, all existing
behaviour of iterating over ``stdClass`` will be retained.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.4

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires
50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'.
