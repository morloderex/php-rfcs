Remove The Date.timezone Warning
================================

:PHP-RFC: 0351
:Title: Remove The Date.timezone Warning
:Author: Bob Weinand <bobwei9@hotmail.com>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2015-01-27
:PHP-Version: 7.0
:Version: 1.2

Introduction
------------

PHP should be usable without configuring it through either an ini file
or defining settings on the command line. Currently this is not possible
as the date.timezone is required to be set, despite it defaulting to the
best option.

"date.timezone" is the only setting that is required to be set. Every
other setting, including those that have security implications default
to sensible values silently; defaulting to sensible values does not
appear to cause any problem for users.

The error message becomes entirely tedious when working with anything
other than a single installed version of PHP.

For example when you want to run the unit tests for a library against
all the different versions of PHP that library supports, you should be
able to do so by downloading each of the PHP versions you want to test
against, and invoking the PHP executables from the download location,
rather than having to install it first.

Proposal
--------

The current behaviour when the data.timezone ini entry is not set is to:

-  Default to UTC.
-  Give a warning message.

The proposal is just to remove the warning message. The behaviour of
setting the timezone to be UTC would not be changed. This will allow
people to run PHP without an ini file without having error messages.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

Targeting the next minor version. (In this case PHP 7, being a major
too.)

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

If the date.timezone ini setting is set but invalid, a warning is still
thrown.

Feedback
--------

"Won't this make life more difficult for end users?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. For users who install PHP through a distribution, the ini file is
created by the package maintainer. They should set it to the systems
timezone. (Some don't, but that is the fault of the distributions.)

For end users who compile from source they can either modify the ini
file that is used by PHP in the compile step or they could add it
themselves when PHP is built e.g. For Debian they could easily stick the
following in a post-install hook to fix it:

::

     echo 'date.timezone='`cat /etc/timezone` > /etc/php/config.d/date.ini
     

People who are compiling PHP from source are perfectly capable of
setting all ini settings that need to be set.

The only people who this RFC will affect are:

-  Those who use multiple versions of PHP or otherwise use PHP without
   going through the install process. This RFC will be beneficial to
   these users.
-  People who have accidentally deleted their ini files from their
   production system. These users have bigger issues than this RFC can
   address.

Still, it is weird, to have that one setting emit a warning, but other
much more important settings don't. The ini settings have defaults and
they should be used.

"Users are idiots and can't be trusted"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, yes. But there are many things that must be set in an ini file for
PHP to be usable in a production environment. The person installing PHP
needs to be capable of setting all of these. The timezone setting is not
the most important setting that needs to be set so it's not good that
PHP gives a warning message when it is not set.

"Can't you just define the timezone in the command line? Like: \`php -d date.timezone=UTC foo.php`"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a painful hack. For people who spend a significant amount of
time either developing PHP, PHP extensions or testing userland code
against multiple PHP versions, they should be able to run PHP code
without getting slapped for the temerity of not using an ini file and
without being forced to set an ini setting to the same default value it
is going to use anyway.
