Counting Of Non-countable Objects
=================================

:PHP-RFC: 0515
:Title: Counting Of Non-countable Objects
:Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2016-10-04
:PHP-Version: 7.2
:Version: 0.4

Introduction
------------

Calling ``count()`` on a scalar or object that doesn't implement the
Countable interface (http://php.net/manual/en/class.countable.php)
returns 1. There are no known use cases for this, and it can easily hide
bugs, take the following example:

.. code:: php

   function handle_records(iterable $iterable)
   {
       if (count($iterable) === 0) {
           return handle_empty();
       }

       foreach ($iterable as $value) {
           handle_value($value);
       }
   }

Passing a Generator that yields nothing would not call
``handle_empty()``, or ``handle_value()``, or alert the developer to the
issue.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes adding a warning when calling ``count()`` with a
parameter that is a scalar, null, or an object that doesn't implement
Countable.

*Note that the sizeof alias is also affected.*
http://php.net/manual/en/function.sizeof.php

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

The call to ``count()`` will still return 1 (or 0 for null) so backwards
compatibility is maintained.

Environments that display warnings or convert them to more severe
errors/exceptions would be affected, but this should just bring
attention to a bug in the code.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.2

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires
50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'.
