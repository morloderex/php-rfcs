Introduction
------------

fsync() is a function similar to fflush(), however where fflush() only
instructs the application to flush its internal buffers out to the OS,
fsync() further instructs the OS to flush its buffers to physical
storage, ensuring a completed and persisted write before returning any
success. PHP provides plain stream wrappers for most common file system
functions inherited from C and is indeed one of few major languages to
not provide any interface to fsync. This RFC proposes implementing fsync
in core.

Proposal
--------

This RFC would add an fsync() function accepting a single parameter of a
stream resource. The implementation of this function would be a thin
wrapper around the standard C fsync (or equivalent \_commit on Windows
API, which uses an identical signature).

The related function fdatasync() which syncs data but not necessarily
metadata would also be added, however this is not supported on Windows
and the proposal there is to still provide fdatasync() but merely as an
alias of fsync(). On POSIX, fdatasync() is properly implemented.

.. code:: php

   $fp = fopen('file.txt', 'w');
   fwrite($fp, 'string');
   var_dump(fsync($fp));

   bool(true)

   $fp = fopen('php://memory','w+');
   fwrite($fp,"Test line 1\nLine 2\n");
   var_dump(fsync($fp));

   Warning: fsync(): Can't fsync this stream in php shell code on line 1
   bool(false)

   $fp = fopen('php://stdin', 'w');
   var_dump(fsync($fp));
   bool(false)

======== Sample documentation ========

fsync() - synchronize changes to a file

fdatasync() - synchronize the data of a file

fsync ( resource $stream ) : bool

Request that all data for the open file pointer $stream is to be
transferred to the storage device. The manner of synchronization is OS
dependent. The fsync() function shall not return until the system has
completed that action or until an error is detected.

Returns true on success or false on failure.

If the resource indicated by $stream is not a file pointer, an E_WARNING
is emitted.
