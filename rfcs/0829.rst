Readonly Classes
================

:PHP-RFC: 0829
:Title: Readonly Classes
:Author: Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2021-08-04
:PHP-Version: 8.2
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

PHP 8.1 added support for ``readonly`` properties via `PHP RFC: Readonly
properties 2.0 </rfc/readonly_properties_v2>`__.

Proposal
--------

The usage of the ``readonly`` modifier added by `PHP RFC: Readonly
properties 2.0 </rfc/readonly_properties_v2>`__ is extended to classes:

.. code:: php

   readonly class Test {
       public string $prop;
   }

Doing so will implicitly mark all typed instance properties of a class
as readonly. Furthermore, it will prevent the usage of dynmacic
properties.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A readonly class can only have typed properties.

Readonly static properties are not supported. This is a technical
limitation, in that it is not possible to implement readonly static
properties non-intrusively. In conjunction with the questionable
usefulness of readonly static properties, this is not considered
worthwhile at this time.

Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly how overriding of readonly properties work, only a readonly
class can extend a readonly class:

.. code:: php

   class A {}
   readonly class B extends A {}

Both of the following are illegal:

.. code:: php

   readonly class A {}
   class B extends A {}

.. code:: php

   class A {}
   readonly class B extends A {}

Reflection
~~~~~~~~~~

A ``ReflectionClass::isReadOnly()`` method is added, which reports
whether a class is declared as read-only.
``ReflectionClass::getModifiers()`` will also report a
``ReflectionClass::IS_READONLY`` flag.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None.

Vote
----

Add readonly classes as proposed?
