Deprecate GET/POST Sessions
===========================

:PHP-RFC: 0837
:Title: Deprecate GET/POST Sessions

Introduction
------------

PHP supports two ways to propagate session token ID: via cookies and
through GET or POST parameters. Cookies are the default preferred method
that has become the de facto standard way of doing it. Using URL
parameters and hidden form input fields has many drawbacks, both in
terms of security and usability, but since cookies may not always be
available, PHP provides that as an alternative option. `PHP
documentation on passing session
ID <https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.idpassing.php>`__

To ease the implementation of this fallback mechanism, a feature called
``use_trans_sid`` is available which will automatically transform all
relative URLs to include the session token ID. This way, if cookies are
not enabled then PHP can seamlessly switch over to using URL parameters.

Using GET/POST to propagate session identifiers is generally considered
a bad practice. For example, see `Why is passing the session id as URL
parameter
insecure? <https://security.stackexchange.com/q/14093/188415>`__

Proposal
--------

The proposal is to deprecate both features: initialization of session
from identifier received via GET/POST, and automatic transformation of
URLs in the script's output.

However, we should not deprecate these INI settings completely. It's
estimated that the vast majority of PHP installations have both of these
features disabled (either consciously or by default) in their INI files.
Thus the deprecation will only apply to setups which have either of
these INI settings enabled.

Setups that use default settings, such as the following, will NOT
trigger a deprecation warning:

::

   session.use_only_cookies=On
   session.use_trans_sid=Off

Installations that have either of these switches in a different position
will generate a deprecation warning:

::

   session.use_only_cookies=Off ; Will generate a deprecation warning
   session.use_trans_sid=On ; Will generate a deprecation warning

Changing any of the following settings will be deprecated:

-  ``session.use_only_cookies``
-  ``session.use_trans_sid``
-  ``session.trans_sid_tags``
-  ``session.trans_sid_hosts``
-  ``session.referer_check``

Setting any of these options through ``session_start()`` to their
non-default value will also be deprecated.

The constant ``SID`` will also be deprecated as part of this RFC. The
standalone proposal to deprecate this constant has also been made in
`Deprecations for PHP 8.4 <deprecations_php_8_4>`__ RFC.

The goal is to remove these features completely in PHP 9.0. The
above-listed INI entries and the constant ``SID`` will be removed.

session.use_cookies = Off
-------------------------

I can't confirm whether it was intentional to allow the usage of cookie
sessions without sending the cookie, but people have used this trick to
adhere to strict PSR-7 standard. As explained by `Paul M. Jones in his
blog <https://paul-m-jones.com/post/2016/04/12/psr-7-and-session-cookies/>`__
disabling ``session.use_cookies`` instructs PHP not to send the session
ID in the cookie upon session start. The responsibility of sending the
cookie with the session ID falls on the developer who can do it at their
most convenient time. For this reason, this INI setting will remain
unaffected.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

Apart from generating a deprecation notice, no other immediate backward
incompatible changes are foreseen. However, once these settings get
removed in the next major PHP version, using any of these INI settings
will become impossible.

Using automatic transformation of URLs will become impossible out of the
box starting with PHP 9.0. To keep using this feature, PHP users will
have to implement it in userland. While PHP will not read the session
token from GET/POST parameters automatically anymore, it will still be
possible to start a session with an ID received in such a way by
manually setting it via ``session_id()``

Unaffected Functionality
------------------------

Function ``output_add_rewrite_var()`` will remain unaffected. Only the
automatic rewriting of URLs to add PHPSESSID will be deprecated.

The hack which allows for manual control of the session cookie using the
INI setting ``session.use_cookies`` will remain possible.

Version
-------

Deprecation in the next minor version, PHP 8.4.

Removal in PHP 9.0.

Vote
----

As per the voting RFC a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for
this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started on 2024-04-09 and will end on 2024-04-23.
