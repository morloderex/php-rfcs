Deprecations For PHP 8.4
========================

:PHP-RFC: 0837
:Title: Deprecations For PHP 8.4
:Author: Niels Dossche <nielsdos@php.net>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Unknown
:Created: 2023-07-25
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.4 and
remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality
targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in
the Proposal section:

-  ``DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo`` and ``DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo``
-  ``DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)``
-  Constant ``DOM_PHP_ERR``
-  ``mysqli_ping()`` and ``mysqli::ping()``

Proposal
--------

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a
2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.4 and removal in
PHP 9.

DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo and DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

schemaTypeInfo used to be a feature of DOM Core Level 3
https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/DOM3-Core.html#core-Attr-schemaTypeInfo,
but it was never implemented in PHP, i.e. it always returns NULL. That
return value is not even correct, as schemaTypeInfo is not supposed to
be nullable. Furthermore, the feature has been removed from the current
living DOM spec. It doesn't make sense to keep a feature alive that has
never been implemented and is removed by the reference specification.

-  Yes
-  No

DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)`` used to be a
feature of DOM Core Level 3
https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/DOM3-Core.html#core-DOMImplementation3-getFeature,
but it was never implemented in PHP, i.e. it always threw a "not
implemented" exception. It was also never documented because of this.
Furthermore, the feature has been removed from the current living DOM
spec. It doesn't make sense to keep a feature alive that has never been
implemented and is removed by the reference specification.

Question: Deprecate DOMImplementation::getFeature($feature, $version)

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

For PHP 8.4 additional deprecation notices will be emitted. The actual
removal of the affected functionality will happen no earlier than PHP 9.
