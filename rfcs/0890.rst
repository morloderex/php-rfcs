Static Class

:PHP-RFC: 0890
:Title: Static Class
:Author: Paul Morris <bilge@scriptfusion.com>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Unknown

Introduction
------------

A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated, and whose members
(properties and methods) are all static. Implicit static classes can be
created today, by simply only including static members. However,
explicitly marking a class as static has several advantages:

-  Clear expression of developer intent.
-  Language-level compile-time checks to verify no instance members are
   included anywhere in the inheritance chain.
-  Language-level runtime checks to verify the class is never
   instantiated by any mechanism.

Of these advantages, the first can be somewhat mitigated with a
`userland
trait <https://github.com/ScriptFUSION/StaticClass/blob/master/src/StaticClass.php>`__,
but as such traits are non-standard, there is no consistent way to
identify them between projects. The language-level checks cannot be so
easily emulated, and are better suited for inclusion within PHP.

Proposal
--------

A *static class* is so marked with the existing ``static`` keyword,
adjacent to the class declaration.

.. code:: php

   static class Foo {}

We introduce the ``static`` keyword at the class level to preclude the
need to create a private constructor. That is,
``function __construct()`` is a compile-time error in a static class.
Furthermore, attempting to instantiate a static by any means, whether
with the ``new`` keyword, ``ReflectionClass::newInstance*`` methods or
``unserialize()`` hacks, is strictly forbidden and will result in a
runtime error.

Whilst the goals of this RFC so expressed are fairly straightforward, we
acknowledge there are many finer points to consider. In particular:

#. Should a static class imply ``final`` (as in C#)?
#. Should a static class prohibit inheritance (as in C#)?
#. Should a static class permit state?
#. Should traits be permitted in a static class?
#. Which magic methods should be supported?

To answer these questions, we consider the principal reason to mark a
class static is to move from an implicit declaration to the explicit.
Ergo, any decision precluding the developer from doing so is invalid.
Thus we derive the following razor:

   We cannot remove features from a static class that would otherwise be
   present in a standard class.

Following this razor we arrive at the following design.

#. A static class may be marked ``final``, but in the absence of such a
   mark, may still be extended.
#. A static class may extend other (static) classes, whether or not so
   marked, provided they contain no instance members.
#. A static class may have static properties.
#. A static class may use traits.
#. All static magic methods must be supported, i.e. just
   ``__callStatic()``.

Static keyword for class members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One question our razor cannot answer is whether static member
declarations still require the ``static`` keyword in a static class.
Marking a class ``readonly`` makes marking properties with the same
*optional*, thus one might argue ``static`` should follow suit. However,
I opine it should not. Unlike ``readonly``, which typically applies to
properties declared near the head of the class (by convention) where the
same mark is also applied, static members appear throughout the full
length of the class body. That is, it should be apparent when jumping
anywhere into a static class that its members are static, without having
to check the class declaration.

There is also third position one might take, to treat static as
*forbidden* for members of a static class. This would probably be an
unpopular option because it requires changing every member declaration
to migrate existing classes, rather than just changing the class
definition. Nevertheless, it is an option.

Choosing whether ``static`` should be *required*, *optional* or
*forbidden* for members of a static class is still open for debate, and
if it cannot be clearly settled on the mailing list, it may be posed as
an additional voting option for this RFC (separately from the static
class feature itself).

Mutually exclusive modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``static`` is applied to a class, the following other class-level
modifiers become invalid and will raise compile-time errors.

-  ``abstract`` — This modifier exists to denote a class cannot be
   instantiated, but the ``static`` modifier already carries this
   meaning.
-  ``readonly`` — Read-only properties are only supported for instance
   properties, but instance properties are forbidden by ``static``.

Anonymous classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anonymous classes are always instantiated and thus at odds with the
concept of a static class. That is, the notion of an *anonymous static
class* is inherently invalid and not supported.

Dynamic properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Undeclared object properties can be added *dynamically* to object
instances, but since static classes cannot be instantiated, there is
nothing to attach such properties to. Static properties must always be
declared explicitly.

Reflection extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``ReflectionClass::isStatic`` method should be added, returning
``true`` when the class is so marked, otherwise ``false``.

Open questions
--------------

#. Should static classes only permit extending *explicitly marked*
   static classes?

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None known.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 8.4

Future Scope
------------

This feature is expected to be complete by itself. However, as noted in
`Readonly properties 2.0 <readonly_properties_v2#restrictions>`__,
read-only static properties are not supported due to a technical
limitation. If that limitation should ever be lifted, we could revisit
lifting the restriction on mutual exclusivity with the ``readonly``
modifier.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

-  A simple yes/no vote to include this feature.
-  A choice between *required*, *optional* or *forbidden* to include
   ``static`` on member declarations within a static class (TBC).

Patches and Tests
-----------------

The patch and tests will be created by myself and/or Lanre. A draft PR
by Lanre is currently available at
https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14583.

Rejected Features
-----------------

Forbidding static class type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It should be regarded as an error to type hint a static class, since
they cannot be instantiated and thus the requirement can never be
fulfilled by a matching instance. However, it is not technically
possible to forbid such hints within PHP itself because type checking is
done when an instance is passed at runtime (and we can never have such
an instance). The engine does not support type checking at compile time
for function/method signatures. Such a check would be a good candidate
for third party static analysers instead.
