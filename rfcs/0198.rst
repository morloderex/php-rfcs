There are methods to work around this:

-  write a mysqlnd plugin (Johannes Schlüter)
-  PDO already support DSN-alias, php.net/pdo.configuration#ini.pdo.dsn
   (Sebastian Krebs)

Introduction
------------

When "localhost" is set as the mysql host, the connection is set to
connect to the specified socket. If no socket is set the hardcoded
default of /tmp/mysql.sock is used.

I have noted the following:

-  many populare php applications put in localhost as the default,
   making it work out of the box for most installations.
-  many distributions patches the default of /tmp/mysql.sock today to
   match where their default MySQL installation puts their unix socket.
-  when splitting a webserver and mysql installation all the
   applications needs to be reconfigured to point at the external mysql
   server.

Proposal and Patch
------------------

I propose we introduce a new option called mysqlnd.localhost_override
which enables a system administrator or php distributor to configure how
localhost should be overriden.

https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/275

It keeps backward compatability by falling back to current behaviour if
mysqlnd.localhost_override is not set.

If the old behaviour were to be deprecated or phased out, a default
value of unix:///tmp/mysql.sock may be appropriate. It would also leave
the behaviour of "localhost" easier to follow.

Documentation
-------------

If this extension of mysqlnd were to be accepted and merged, the
documentation must be updated to include the new option and its syntax.

Example of
usage:``mysqlnd.localhost_override = unix:///var/run/mysql/mysqld.sock
mysqlnd.localhost_override = tcp://otherhost:3306``
