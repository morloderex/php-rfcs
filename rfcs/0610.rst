RFC: Always Available Hash Extension
====================================

:PHP-RFC: 0610
:Title: RFC: Always Available Hash Extension
:Author: Kalle Sommer Nielsen <kalle@php.net>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2018-09-04
:PHP-Version: 7.4
:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

This RFC proposes to make the hash extension (`ext/hash`) always
available, similar to the \`date`, \`spl\` & \`pcre\` extensions.

Proposal
--------

The hash extension provides a very rich utility with many hashing
algorithms which is extremely useful in modern day applications, not
only in userland code but also very much in internals.

After a recent discussion on Github[1], Johannes proposed that the hash
extension should be treated as special extension which cannot be
disabled.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

Build configurations that contain \`--enable-hash\` will have to be
updated, as the argument will cease to exists. The \`--with-mhash\`
argument will continue to stay.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

Target PHP version is the next master, which at the time of writing is
most likely 7.4.

RFC Impact
----------

To SAPIs and Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only impact on SAPIs, Extensions and PECL extensions is that they
can now always rely on the \`hash\` extension to be available and
utilize its API without having external dependencies for such.

This naturally also means that minimal builds of PHP will slightly grow
in size.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

Any already existing userland code will continue to work as before.
Userland may remove calls to \`extension_loaded('hash')\` as they will
now always return true.

The hash extension does not have any external dependencies, so this will
not add any more dependencies for a minimal build of PHP.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Since this touches a major component in the php-src source, the voting
will require a 2/3 majority to pass.

Vote
----

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.

Question: Make the hash extension always available as described in this RFC?
