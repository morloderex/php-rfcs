Introduction
------------

MCRYPT_RAND should removed from PHP 7.0 so that developers are
discouraged from using it in production systems or in frameworks used by
other developers. MCRYPT_RAND is a constant that instructs
mcrypt_create_iv() to use a non-cryptographically-secure entropy source.
While IVs do not have the same secrecy requirements as a private key,
they should be unpredictable. Using MCRYPT_RAND is therefore unsuitable
for cryptographic applications.

Proposal
--------

The following changes should be made:

-  MCRYPT_RAND should be removed as of PHP 7.0.
-  With MCRYPT_RAND gone, mcrypt_create_iv() should transparently fall
   back to the default (currently MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM)

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

The MCRYPT_RAND constant will be removed, and support for it will also
be removed.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

This proposal should be considered for the PHP 7.0.
