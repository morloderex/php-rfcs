:Title: Implement Strrstr Counterpart To Strstr For Consistency

:Version: 0.9

Introduction
------------

Implement ``strrstr`` (and possibly ``strristr``) for consistency with
the ``strpos`` string functions family.

Currently there exist no "proper" counter part to the ``strstr`` (and
``stristr``) standard string function. There exist ``strrchr`` however
it does not have the same signature as ``strstr`` nor ``strchr`` as
``strchr`` is an alias of ``strstr``, nor does it provide the same
features.

Proposal
--------

Implement ``strrstr`` and ``strristr`` (?) in PHP 7.4 with the same
features as ``strstr``, meaning that the ``$needle`` parameter can
accept multiple characters and add a boolean parameter
``$before_needle`` which has a default value of ``false``.

Pros
----

-  Consistency within the standard library
-  Feature built-in to the language

Cons
----

-  More "bloat" in the global namespace
-  Follows an old naming scheme
-  Adds a function alias to the language
-  Easily implemented in userland

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

Next minor i.e. PHP 7.4.

Open Issues
-----------

How to handle the newly created alias.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

2/3 Majority for adding ``strrstr`` (and possibly ``strristr`` after
discussion).

Patches and Tests
-----------------

GitHub PR `#4064 <https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4064>`__

Implementation
--------------

After the project is implemented, this section should contain

#. the version(s) it was merged into
#. a link to the git commit(s)
#. a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
#. a link to the language specification section (if any)
