Introduction
------------

Adds the possibility to cast values while using array or list
destructuring expressions.

Motivation
----------

This proposal aims at type casts when working with data from a untyped
source (eg. iterating over a CSV file, XML without a XSD defining the
types of the elements). This data can often be handled in an elegant way
using the existing capabilities of array destructuring. While simple
variable assignments can be casted during the assignment this isn't
possible during assignments via array destructuring. This proposal adds
a new syntax for casting in array assignments. An example when handling
a CSV file may look like:

::

   1,Test,2002
   2,Example,2010
   3,Demo,2016

.. code:: php

   $handle = fopen('test.csv', 'r');
   while (($data = fgetcsv($handle)) !== false) {
       [(int) $id, (string) $data, (int) $year] = $data;
       // ...
   }

Proposal
--------

While a simple variable assignment is able to execute a type cast this
possibility isn't present for array or list destructuring expressions.
Instead all values are assigned as they are:

.. code:: php

   // simple assignment with a cast
   $now = (int) "2020";
   // array destructuring without cast
   [$now, $future] = ["2020", "2021"];

If the values stored in $a and $b after the array destructuring shall be
casted each value must be casted manually afterwards:

.. code:: php

   [$now, $future] = ["2020", "2021"];
   // either touch each value manually, use array_map or any other implementation approach to cast the values
   $now = (int) $now;
   $future = (int) $future;

This RFC proposes the possibility to cast the values inside the
destructuring expression:

.. code:: php

   // destructuring and casting of a numeric array
   [(int) $now, (int) $future] = ["2020", "2021"];

   // destructuring and casting of an assiciative array
   ["now" => (int) $now, "future" => (int) $future] = ["now" => "2020", "future" => "2021"];

   // destructuring and casting of a nested array
   [
       "2020s" => [
           "now" => (int) $now,
           "future" => (int) $future
       ]
   ] = [
       "2020s" => [
           "now" => "2020",
           "future" => "2021"
       ],
       "2030s" => [
           "far away" => "2039"
       ]
   ];

   // destructuring and casting in a foreach loop
   $years = [["now", "2020"], ["future", "2021"]];
   foreach ($years as [$description, (int) $year]) {
       // ...
   }

While examples where all values should be casted to the identical type
may be solved reasonably elegant with solutions like array_map it get's
more difficult if the casts should cover various types:

.. code:: php

   // destructuring and casting with various types
   ["address" => (bool) $hasAddress, "floor" => (int) $floor] = ["address" => "My adress", "floor" => "3"];

All of the examples above also work with the list() syntax.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

Next PHP version (target 8.0)

RFC Impact
----------

To SAPIs
~~~~~~~~

None

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None

To Opcache
~~~~~~~~~~

Implementation uses existing functions to compile the code. So existing
Opcache implementations for assignments and castings are used.

Open Issues
-----------

Discussion
----------

Regular type checks

During the discussion especially the idea of regular type checks instead
of castings came up:

.. code:: php

   $years = ["2020", "2021"];
   [int $now, int $future] = $years;

As a regular type check depends on the declare strict_types directive
concerning the casting feature (strict_types=0 would result in an
implicit cast similar to the proposed feature while strict_types=1 would
result in a type error when the provided data doesn't match the type
check) a regular type check covers different use cases than the proposed
casting feature. (Also see future scopes)

Future Scope
------------

Future scopes may include type casts during reference assignments which
lead to a cast of the referenced variable (compare
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/list_reference_assignment for reference
assignments without casts):

.. code:: php

   // reference assignment cast
   $now = "2020";
   $now2 = (int) &$now;

   // reference assignment cast combined with array destructuring
   $years = ["2020", "2021"];
   [(int) &$now, (int) &$future] = $years;

--------------

Future scopes may include strict type casts which avoid eg. (!int) "No
Number String" to be casted to 0:

.. code:: php

   // strict assignment cast
   $now = "2020";
   $now2 = (!int) $now;

   // strict assignment cast combined with array destructuring
   $years = ["2020", "2021"];
   [(!int) $now, (!int) $future] = $years;

--------------

Future scopes may include nullable type casts (compare
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable-casting):

.. code:: php

   // nullable assignment cast
   $now = "2020";
   $now2 = (?int) $now;

   // nullable assignment cast combined with array destructuring
   $years = ["2020", "2021", null];
   [(?int) $now, (?int) $future, (?int) $evenLater] = $years;

--------------

Future scopes may include regular type checks which depend on
strict_types directive:

.. code:: php

   $years = ["2020", "2021"];
   [int $now, int $future] = $years;

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Voting starts 2020-04-09 and ends 2020-04-23.

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. The vote is a
straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC and merging the patch.

Question: Add type casting in array destructuring expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Voting Choices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  yes
-  no

--------------

As the future scopes section of this proposal includes a lot of possible
topics an additional poll to see which of these topics may be tackled in
the near future:

Question: Choose one or more of the suggested future scopes in which you are interested
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _voting-choices-1:

Voting Choices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  reference assignment casts
-  strict casts
-  nullable casts
-  type checks in array destructuring expressions
-  none

Patches and Tests
-----------------

The parser is already able to parse the syntax and requires no changes.
The patch adds a change in the compile process in
zend_compile_list_assign to be able to handle casting AST elements.
