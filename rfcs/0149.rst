:Title: Define PHP 5.3 End Of Life
:Author: Pierre Joye <pierre@php.net>
:Status: Active
:Type: Process
:Created: 2012-03-02
:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this RFC is to define when the PHP 5.3 series will no
longer be supported.

As PHP 5.3 was released before the new release process was defined and
implemented, we have to define a clear EOL  [1]_.

Even if the 5.3 release manager already stated something about the
status of PHP 5.3, it is critical for us to have a clear and open
decision. PHP 5.3 is still the most widely (maintained) branch and many
projects rely on it as a minimum version. It is also important to keep
in mind that we won't have this problem anymore in 5.4 or later and the
life cycle is already clearly defined by the `release process
RFC <rfc/releaseprocess>`__.

Two years: one normal fixes and one security fixes only
-------------------------------------------------------

One year with bug fixes followed by one year with security fixes only.

Security issues cover only bugs marked as security issues or defined as
such by the PHP Security team.

Two years with security fixes only
----------------------------------

Two years with security fixes only. Security issues cover only bugs
marked as security issues or defined as such by the PHP Security Team.

One year with normal and security fixes
---------------------------------------

One year with bug fixes (both security and normal bugs).

One year with security fixes only
---------------------------------

One year with security fixes only.
