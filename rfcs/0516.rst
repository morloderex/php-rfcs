Deprecate Png2wbmp() And Jpeg2wbmp()
====================================

:PHP-RFC: 0516
:Title: Deprecate Png2wbmp() And Jpeg2wbmp()
:Author: Christoph M. Becker <cmb@php.net>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2016-10-15
:PHP-Version: 7.2
:Version: 1.1

Introduction
------------

``png2wbmp()`` and ``jpeg2wbmp()`` are the only direct image format
conversion functions available in ext/gd which makes them rather
special, particularly as libgd doesn't offer any such functions  [1]_.
Furthermore WBMP  [2]_ has been invented to support WAP  [3]_, which
appears to be mostly obsolete nowadays.

Proposal
--------

Therefore I propose to deprecate the ``png2wbmp()`` and ``jpeg2wbmp()``
functions as of PHP 7.2, and to remove them as of PHP 8.0. During the
deprecation phase calling either function should emit an E_DEPRECATED
error.

The main benefit in doing so would be easier maintainance of the libgd
bindings
(`\_php_image_convert() <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-7.0.12/ext/gd/gd.c#L4018-L4215>`__
alone accounts for rougly 200 lines). An additional benefit would be to
have a slightly cleaner and less confusing API (Why are there no other
conversion functions? Why don't these functions follow the general
"image" prefix rule?)

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

Obviously, code still using png2wbmp() or jpeg2wbmp() would break.
However, fallback functions could easily `implemented in
userland <http://news.php.net/php.internals/96366>`__. The supposedly
long deprecation period should give users ample time to cater to the
removal.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

-  Deprecation as of next PHP 7.x
-  Removal as of next major (supposedly PHP 8.0)

Open Issues
-----------

Currently none.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

``imagewbmp()`` and ``image2wbmp()`` are not subject of this RFC, and as
such their functionality will remain unmodified.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Deprecate and remove the functions: yes or no.

This RFC requires a 50%+1 majority.

Voting ends on 2016-11-13, 22:00 UTC.
