Introduction
------------

``uniqid()``, against all expectations from the name, doesn't produce
unique IDs. While there is a ``sleep()`` to prevent multiple duplicate
IDs in the same process, there's no such guarantee and even a rather
high probability of duplicate IDs with more processes or even multiple
servers. This is due to ``uniqid()`` being time based and adding only
insufficient random.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes to emit deprecation warnings for any usage of
``uniqid()``. Current usages should be replaced with either
``bin2hex(random_bytes(16))`` (or any other encoding of choice) or an
UUID implementation.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

All BC breaks are intentional and outlined in the RFC.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

Deprecation notice in PHP 7.3 and removal in PHP 8.0.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Simple yes / no vote with 2/3 majority.

Maybe a second vote for skipping removal in PHP 8.0 and delaying it to a
later RFC.

Patches and Tests
-----------------

TBD.
