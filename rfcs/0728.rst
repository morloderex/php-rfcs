Add CMS Support

:PHP-RFC: 0728
:Title: Add CMS Support
:Author: Eliot Lear <lear@lear.ch>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2020-05-13
:PHP-Version: 8.0
:Version: 0.9

Introduction
------------

PHP has for some time incorporated support for PKCS#7 sign, verify,
encrypt, decrypt, and read operations. Cryptographic Message Syntax
(CMS) is a newer version of PKCS#7. Having been around some time, CMS is
used in both email messaging as well as signature verification
operations relating to IoT devices.

Proposal
--------

It is proposed that analogous functions be created for CMS. These would
be as follows:

======================= =====================
PKCS#7 function         new CMS function
======================= =====================
openssl_pkcs7_encrypt() openssl_cms_encrypt()
openssl_pkcs7_decrypt() openssl_cms_decrypt()
openssl_pkcs7_sign()    openssl_cms_sign()
openssl_pkcs7_verify () openssl_cms_verify()
openssl_pkcs7_read ()   openssl_cms_read()
======================= =====================

As currently stands, the CMS sign and verify functions now can take as
an argument the encoding method (DER/CMS/PEM).

Calling Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: php

   function openssl_cms_sign(string $infile, string $outfile, $signcert, $signkey, ?array $headers, int $flags = 0, int $encoding = OPENSSL_ENCODING_SMIME, ?string $extracertsfilename = null): bool {}

This function signs a file with an X.509 certificate and key.

Arguments:

-  $infile - the name of the file to be signed
-  $outfile - the name of the file to deposit the results
-  $signcert - the name of the file containing the signing certificate
-  $signkey - the name of file containing the key associated with
   $signcert
-  $headers - an array of headers to be included in S/MIME output
-  $flags - flags to be passed to cms_sign()
-  $encoding - the encoding of the output file
-  $extracertsfilename - intermediate certificates to be included in the
   signature

.. code:: php

   function openssl_cms_verify(string $filename, int $flags = 0, string $signerscerts = UNKNOWN, array $cainfo = UNKNOWN, string $extracerts = UNKNOWN, string $content = UNKNOWN, string $pk7 = UNKNOWN, string $sigfile = UNKNOWN, $encoding = OPENSSL_ENCODING_SMIME ): bool {}

This function verifies a CMS signature, either attached or detached,
with the specified encoding.

Arguments:

-  $filename - the input file
-  $flags - flags that would be passed to cms_verify
-  $signercerts - a file that the signer certificate and optionally
   intermediate certificates
-  $cainfo - an array containing self-signed certificate authority
   certificates
-  $extracerts - a file containing additional intermediarte certificates
-  $content - a file pointing to the content when signatures are
   detached
-  $pk7 - a file to save the signature to
-  $encoding - one of three supported encodings (PEM/DER/SMIME).

Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.

.. code:: php

   function openssl_cms_encrypt(string $infile, string $outfile, $recipcerts, ?array $headers, int $flags = 0, int $encoding = OPENSSL_ENCODING_SMIME,  int $cipher = OPENSSL_CIPHER_RC2_40): bool {}

This function encrypts content to one or more recipients, based on the
certificates that are passed to it.

Arguments:

-  $infile - the file to be encrypted
-  $outfile - the output file
-  $recipcerts - recipients to encrypt to
-  $headers - headers to include when S/MIME is usd
-  $flags - Flags to be passed to CMS_sign
-  $encoding - an encoding to output
-  $cipher - a cypher to use

Return values: TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

.. code:: php

   function openssl_cms_decrypt(string $infilename, string $outfilename, $recipcert, $recipkey = UNKNOWN, int $encoding = OPENSSL_ENCODING_SMIME): bool {}

Decrypts a CMS message.

Arguments:

-  $infilename - the name of a file containing encrypted content
-  $outfilename - the name of the file to deposit the decrypted content
-  $recipcert - the name of the file containing a certificate of the
   recipient
-  $recipkey - the name of the file containing a PKCS#8 key
-  $encoding - the encoding of the input file.

Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.

.. code:: php

   function openssl_cms_read(string $infilename, &$certs): bool {}

Performs the exact analog to openssl_pkcs7_read().

This is **nearly** identical to the PKCS#7 calling interface, the only
exception being $encoding.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 8.0

RFC Impact
----------

To SAPIs
~~~~~~~~

The only change is an additional API. No modifications to existing APIs.

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New functions are added to ext/openssl. No existing functions are
changed.

To Opcache
~~~~~~~~~~

No known impact.

New Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several new constants are defined to indicate encoding, as follows:

::

   OPENSSL_ENCODING_CMS /* encoding is a CMS-encoded message */
   OPENSSL_ENCODING_DER /* encoding is DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) */
   OPENSSL_ENCODING_PEM /* encoding is PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) */

The following analogs to PKCS#7 are also added:

::

   OPENSSL_CMS_DETACHED
   OPENSSL_CMS_TEXT
   OPENSSL_CMS_NOINTERN
   OPENSSL_CMS_NOVERIFY
   OPENSSL_CMS_NOCERTS
   OPENSSL_CMS_NOATTR
   OPENSSL_CMS_BINARY
   OPENSSL_CMS_NOSIGS

php.ini Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No change.

Open Issues
-----------

No known issues.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

As these are new functions, no side effects to other functions should be
expected.

Future Scope
------------

Currently, as with the PKCS#7 calls, these calls take files as
arguments. Future work should focus on in-memory
signing/encrypting/verifying/decrypting operations.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the
proposed voting options.

Patches and Tests
-----------------

This capability is available for inspection as `PR
#5251 <https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5251>`__. Tests are available
in that PR. This PR is subject to change of course, based on community
feedback.
