History
^^^^^^^

PECL versioning has historically been fairly anarchic. This made it
impossible to determine the status of an extension, or whether an update
would break binary compatibility with previous versions (or work with a
given PHP release) without a long try-&-fail process. Some of the
processes in php.net that currently use hard-coded lists could also
benefit from a standardized versioning process.

The base proposal was implemented across PECL by April 2008. Only the
question of what to do about PHP extensions that are both in PECL and in
the PHP core - and usually symlinked - remains open. *It would be nice
to resolve this before the PHP 5.3.0 release!*

There are actually two RFCs (proposals) to deal with version numbering
in PECL and for core PHP extensions in general.
