Change Directory Class To Behave Like An Opaque Object
======================================================

:PHP-RFC: 0843
:Title: Change Directory Class To Behave Like An Opaque Object
:Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2024-09-14
:PHP-Version: 8.5
:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

The ``Directory`` class is probably the first instance of what we now
call an "opaque object". Opaque objects are normally the result of
converting resources to objects, which in general implies, being
``final``, being not serializable, not constructible via ``new``, cannot
be cast, and to not implement any methods. However, as this class has
existed since PHP 4 none of these things are formally implemented.

Valid instances of this class are created by calling the ``dir()``
function. But one can create a broken instance by just using
``new Directory()``, which is visible if one tries to call one of its
methods.

As it seems likely that we will repurpose this class when converting
directory resources to objects; we think it makes sense to already
convert this class to behave like an opaque object.

Proposal
--------

We propose to make the following changes to the ``Directory`` class:

-  Make it ``final``
-  Throw an ``Error`` when doing ``new Directory()``
-  Prevent cloning instances of ``Directory``
-  Ban serialization of it via the ``@not-serializable`` doc comment on
   the class stub
-  Ban creating dynamic properties on an instance of ``Directory`` via
   the ``@strict-properties`` doc comment on the class stub

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

It will no longer be possible:

-  to extend the ``Directory`` class
-  clone, serialize, or create dynamic properties on an instance of
   ``Directory``
-  instantiate ``Directory`` directly via the ``new`` keyword

Version
-------

Next minor version, i.e. PHP 8.5.

Vote
----

As per the voting RFC a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for
this proposal to be accepted.

Voting started on 2024-XX-XX and will end on 2024-XX-XX.
