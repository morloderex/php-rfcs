Abstract
^^^^^^^^

The current parser is bison based. The plan (initially proposed as a
GSoC idea) is to replace it with Lemon, which is thread-safe and
reentrant.

This task can be divided into two main parts:

-  rewrite zend_language_parser.y into a syntax Lemon understands.
-  generate the template for an engine/re2c integration.

Writing the syntax file is pretty straight-forward, though some
additional rules need to be implemented in order to reproduce those
bison "mid-rule actions", which isn't supported by Lemon. It might be a
good idea to rethink some of the rules' names along the way.

News from the front
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rewrite is finished, but we still need to figure out some slight
performance issues.

An effect of the yacc->lemon switch is that tokens are no longer named
in error messages.

Before:

Unexpected T_IF

Now:

Unexpected 'if'
