Deprecate Inconsistent Cast Names

:PHP-RFC: 0587
:Title: Deprecate Inconsistent Cast Names
:Author: Chris Wright <daverandom@php.net>
:Status: Withdrawn
:Type: Standards Track

:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

Scalar type declarations use only a single name for each numeric type,
but casts permit some variation. This RFC proposes to deprecate the
variants that are not valid as type declarations for reasons of
consistency.

Proposal
--------

The following cast forms will emit ``E_DEPRECATED`` errors, with a
schedule for removal to be agreed either during discussion of this RFC
or in a subsequent RFC:

.. code:: php

   (integer) // use (int)
   (boolean) // use (bool)
   (double)  // use (float)
   (real)    // use (float)

The main reason for this is to help ensure that code is consistent and
obviously readable.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

Any code which uses these cast forms will now emit ``E_DEPRECATED``
errors.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.3

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Yes/No, with a 2/3 majority required.

Patches and Tests
-----------------

No implementation currently exists.
