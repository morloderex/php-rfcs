:Title: Grapheme Cluster For Str_split Function: Grapheme_str_split

Introduction
------------

I noticed PHP does not have a grapheme cluster based str_split function.
So I think need str_split for grapheme cluster, grapheme_str_split
function using ICU. Creating this function in the Intl extension would
provide stronger support for grapheme clusters. This feature will allow
to correctly handle emoji and Variation Selectors.

grapheme_str_split function is correctly support for grapheme cluster.

::

   $ sapi/cli/php -r 'var_dump(grapheme_str_split("🙇‍♂️"));'
   array(1) {
     [0]=>
     string(13) "🙇‍♂️"
   }

For example, compare to mb_str_split function, mb_str_split function is
str_split for Unicode codepoint. (Of course, sometimes this is more
convenient.)

::

   $ sapi/cli/php -r 'var_dump(mb_str_split("🙇‍♂️"));'
   array(4) {
     [0]=>
     string(4) "🙇"
     [1]=>
     string(3) "‍" // U+200D Zero Width Joinner
     [2]=>
     string(3) "♂"
     [3]=>
     string(3) "️" // U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR
   }

Until now, PCRE functions were required to support grapheme clusters.

::

   $ sapi/cli/php -r  'preg_match_all("/(\X)/u", "🙇‍♂️", $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE); var_dump($matches[1]);'
   array(1) {
     [0]=>
     array(2) {
       [0]=>
       string(13) "🙇‍♂️"
       [1]=>
       int(0)
     }
   }

Examples of other languages. Ruby is already support grapheme clusters
as
`String#each_grapheme_clusters <https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/String.html#method-i-grapheme_clusters>`__

::

   s = "\u0061\u0308-pqr-\u0062\u0308-xyz-\u0063\u0308" # => "ä-pqr-b̈-xyz-c̈"
   s.grapheme_clusters
   # => ["ä", "-", "p", "q", "r", "-", "b̈", "-", "x", "y", "z", "-", "c̈"]

Proposal
--------

Add grapheme_str_split function.

::

   function grapheme_str_split(string $string, int $length = 1): array|false {}

$string is only support UTF-8. $length is the length of the grapheme
cluster per element of the array.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

This could break a function existing in userland with the same name.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

next PHP 8.x
