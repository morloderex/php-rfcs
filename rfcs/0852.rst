Introduction
------------

This RFC proposes to make anonymous classes final by default.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes to make anonymous classes final by default.

The main reason for this change, in my view, is to allow some additional
opcache optimizations, such as any JIT logic gated behind a check on
ZEND_ACC_FINAL, i.e.
https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/opcache/jit/zend_jit_trace.c#L4507.

Another reason is mentioned by Nikita in
https://externals.io/message/121906#121909: "It makes very little sense
to me that everyone needs to explicitly mark their anonymous classes as
final just because there is a class_alias loophole that could, in
theory, have been used to extend anonymous classes in the past".

Example, extending an anonymous class throws an error:

.. code:: php

   $x = new class {};
   class_alias($x::class, 'alias');
   class aliasExtends extends alias {}

``Fatal error: Class aliasExtends cannot extend final class class@anonymous in %s on line %d``

Optionally, an ``open`` keyword inspired by Kotlin can be introduced to
optionally make anonymous classes non-final.

Example, extending an open anonymous class does not throw an error:

.. code:: php

   $x = new open class {};
   class_alias($x::class, 'alias');
   class aliasExtends extends alias {}

Rationale regarding ``open``:

On one hand, looking at code like ``new class {}``, you would assume
that since the class apparently has no name, it should not be impossible
to extend it, but on the other hand, there are valid usecases for
extending even anonymous classes (comments in the PR
(https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/11126 referenced proxying), and I
can also think of phpunit mocking: completely precluding the possibility
of mocking a class that

#. Has a name (even if it's not immediately obvious)
#. Can be referenced to using its name (``class_exists``,
   ``new ReflectionClass``, ``new $clazz``, and yes, even
   ``class_alias``)

seems a tad bit too restrictive...

On the other hand, I also really don't like non-final classes, in all of
my projects, I use CS rules that force all classes to either be abstract
or final, because unfortunately, I've had to work with a lot of code
that very frequently violates encapsulation by using inheritance.

Still, there are some useful patterns, mainly regarding testing and
mocking, for example I use https://github.com/dg/bypass-finals as a dev
dependency to make all final classes non-final at runtime to allow
mocking in phpunit, but it works by installing a custom default stream
contexts that intercepts requires, tokenizes files and removes final
keywords from classes; this approach would break for anonymous classes
if they were rendered final by default without an option to make them
non-final.

Thus, I also propose the additional of an optional ``open`` keyword that
can be used to make anonymous classes non-final.

The implementation PR will be provided by me in case of acceptance.
