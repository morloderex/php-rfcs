Add Http_(get|clear)_last_response_headers() Function
=====================================================

:PHP-RFC: 0852
:Title: Add Http_(get|clear)_last_response_headers() Function
:Author: Gina Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
:Status: Draft
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2024-01-03
:PHP-Version: 8.4
:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

The
`$http_response_header <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httpresponseheader.php>`__
variable is magically created in the local scope whenever an HTTP
request is performed through PHP's stream layer, i.e. when using the
`HTTP wrapper <https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.http.php>`__. One
such usage is using ``file_get_content()`` to retrieve the content of a
URL.

The
`$http_response_header <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httpresponseheader.php>`__
variable will contain all the HTTP headers that were encountered during
the request performed via the HTTP wrapper.

All other features using this operating principle, such as
`$php_errormsg <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.phperrormsg.php>`__,
have been removed because creating a variable in the local scope is a
terrible way of returning additional information. This variable itself
was initially slated `to be deprecated in PHP
8.1 </rfc/deprecations_php_8_1#predefined_variable_http_response_header>`__,
but due to a lack of convenient alternatives, it was removed from the
proposal at that time.

This variable is created and populated even if the HTTP request fails, a
behaviour that requires dropping down to the stream layer, providing an
additional stream context to ignore errors. Subsequently, the user can
manually parse the response header and detect if the HTTP request failed
or not. This is impractical and a better interface would be simply
checking if the return value of the initial call was ``false``.

As a replacement, we propose adding functions similar to
``error_get_last()``/``error_clear_last()`` which replaced
`$php_errormsg <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.phperrormsg.php>`__.

Proposal
--------

Add the following two functions:

-  ``function http_get_last_response_header(): ?array``
-  ``function http_clear_last_response_header(): void``

``http_get_last_response_header()`` would provide the same information
as
`$http_response_header <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httpresponseheader.php>`__
if a request via the HTTP wrapper is made, and also return the headers
as an array even when the request fails. If no request via the HTTP
wrapper is made, or the last headers have been cleared by calling
``http_clear_last_response_header()``, then ``null`` is returned.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

As this RFC does not yet propose deprecating
`$http_response_header <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httpresponseheader.php>`__
there are no backward incompatible changes.

Considering the possible simplification to the engine and the optimizer
by removing this last usage of the capability to create a variable in
this way, we have conducted a usage analysis of the feature. We found
only 65 usages in 30 projects across a sample of over 900 projects
(composer packages, standalone open source projects, and private
codebases) which were analyzed with `Exakat <https://www.exakat.io>`__.
[1] Most of those usages stem from packages like Guzzle or OAuth client
libraries.

It is impossible to polyfill this feature, however it is possible to
write cross version compatible code in the following way:

.. code:: php

   $content = file_get_contents('http://example.com/');
   if (function_exists('http_get_last_response_headers')) {
       $http_response_header = http_get_last_response_headers();
   }
   // Use $http_response_header as before

Considering the sparse usage of this feature, the possibility to write
cross version compatible code, and the possible engine and optimizer
simplifications, it seems reasonable to slate this feature for removal
even without a deprecation notice if the need arises.

Version
