Closure Self Reference
======================

:PHP-RFC: 0764
:Title: Closure Self Reference
:Author: Danack
:Status: Draft
:Type: Unknown
:Created: 2020-11-10
:Version: 0.2

Introduction
------------

Currently, the main way used to call a closure from within that closure,
is to bind a variable by reference into the closure, when the closure is
created.

However this can lead to shenanigans:

.. code:: php

   $fibonacci = function (int $n) use (&$fibonacci) {
       if ($n === 0) return 0;
       if ($n === 1) return 1;
       return $fibonacci($n-1) + $fibonacci($n-2);
   };

   echo $fibonacci(10). "\n";
   $this_is_the_original_fibonacci = $fibonacci;
   // ... many lines of code here
   $fibonacci = function (int $n) { return rand(0, $n); };
   // ... many lines of code here

   echo $this_is_the_original_fibonacci(10). "\n";

i.e. a change to the variable outside the closure has modified the
behaviour of the closure. That a closure can change behaviour like this
violates the `Principle of least
astonishment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment>`__

Proposal
--------

Allow closures to be aliased to a variable that can be used within the
closure:

.. code:: php

   $fibonacci = function (int $n) as $fibonacci {
       if ($n === 0) return 0;
       if ($n === 1) return 1;
       return $fibonacci($n-1) + $fibonacci($n-2);
   };
