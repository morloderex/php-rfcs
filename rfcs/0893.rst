:Title: Support Optional Suffix Parameter In Tempnam

Introduction
------------

The **tempnam** function allows users to optionally specify a **prefix**
to be prepended to the generated filenames.

It would be useful to allow users to also specify a **suffix** when
generating temporary files. For instance, a suffix could provide even
more semantic value or context for a user inspecting the generated
files, and, in specific situations, could even provide more context for
software processing such files.

Proposal
--------

Add a new optional suffix parameter to the tempnam function, changing
its signature from

.. code:: php

   tempnam(string $directory, string $prefix): string|false

to

.. code:: php

   tempnam(string $directory, string $prefix, string $suffix = ""): string|false

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code:: php

   tempnam("/tmp", "application-");
   /* /tmp/application-xxxxxx */

   tempnam("/tmp", "", ".pdf");
   /* /tmp/xxxxxx.pdf */

   tempnam("/tmp", "application-", ".pdf");
   /* /tmp/application-xxxxxx.pdf */

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

None with exception of changing the signature of the internal
php_do_open_temporary_file function, which is not exported.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

next PHP 8.x.

RFC Impact
----------

The suffix-parameter is optional. Thus it is transparent to any existing
PHP-code in use.

Only the internal API is affected because of the additional parameter
which is added. Still, this only includes the addition of a new function
(php_open_temporary_fd_ex2) and changing the signature of the
php_do_open_temporary_file function, which is not exported.

Open Issues
-----------

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

All but tempnam and the internal php_do_open_temporary_file function.

Future Scope
------------

The **tempnam** **prefix** paramter is sanitized through the
**basename** function when path separators are present in the provided
string, using only the last part of the provided path. For instance,
**foo/bar** would become **bar**. We could not find the historical
reasons for the **prefix** parameter to behave as described, but for
consistency, we are currently using the same approach for the new
**suffix** parameter.

Moreover,o nly the 63 first characters passed to the **prefix** paramter
are used. Although we could not find the historical reasons behind this
decision, we are currently replicating the behavior for the new
**suffix** parameter.

Finally, **In windows systems**, none of the characters passed as a
suffix will be appended to the file name (i.e., **the suffix parameter
will be ignored**). This is due to the underlying function (and API)
used to generate temporary files, which do not provide means to set a
suffix. While we could provide a custom implementation, the current
windows API being used includes a .TMP extension to the generated files,
which AFAICT, does matter in windows systems. I also found a related
discussion in an old bug at https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44222.
Changing such behaviors would require a different RFC.

Therefore, the following changes are left for future work:

\* Re-visit tempnam's implementation to verify the need to truncate the
prefix/suffix params at 64 characters. \* Re-visit tempnam's
implementation to verify the need to modify the prefix/suffix params
thorugh the basename function. \* Re-work tempnam's windows
implementation to match the default non-windows behaviors.

The first two could be part of a minor refactoring effort for tempnam.
The last one, however, should be part of a major refactoring effort for
tempnam.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Accept this RFC and accept an optional **suffix** parameter in the
**tempnam** function? Yes / No
