:Title: Hash Functions Empty Key Warning

Introduction
------------

In order to increase security of the hashing functions, this RFC
proposes raising a warning when the key is empty for hash_hmac(),
hash_hmac_file() & mhash().

Proposal
--------

It's not uncommon to accidentally hash data with an empty or
`non-string <http://www.cryptofails.com/post/70059595978/myself-using-the-same-key-to-encrypt-everything>`__
key. Doing this `has security
implications <http://www.hpenterprisesecurity.com/vulncat/en/vulncat/java/key_management_empty_hmac_key.html>`__
that currently happen quietly in the background since `PHP has no issue
hashing data with an empty key <https://3v4l.org/AF998>`__. To bring the
security issue to the attention of the user, a warning should be raised
if the key is empty.

Ideally this would throw a fatal error, but as `Enrico Zimuel pointed
out <https://twitter.com/ezimuel/status/721006534847832064>`__, it's not
technically an error.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.1

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

This project requires a 2/3 majority to pass.

Patches and Tests
-----------------

`The patch is very light
weight <https://github.com/php/php-src/compare/master...SammyK:hash-hmac-warning?expand=1>`__
- most of it is just the tests.
