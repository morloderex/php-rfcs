Introduction
------------

In PHP, if continue is applied to a switch statement, it behaves the
same as break. In other languages, it would continue the surrounding
loop instead. To avoid confusion, this RFC proposes to deprecate and
remove continues acting on switch.

The following example demonstrates the current behavior:

.. code:: php

   while ($foo) {
       switch ($bar) {
           case "baz":
               continue; // In PHP: Behaves like "break;"
                         // In C:   Behaves like "continue 2;"
       }
   }

While ``continue`` and ``break`` are synonymous in this context,
``break`` is used almost exclusively, by convention and due to
familiarity from other languages. Attempts to use ``continue`` are
almost certainly attempts to achieve the behavior of ``continue 2`` by
programmers who are not familiar with this PHP-ism.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes to deprecate in PHP 7.3 and remove in PHP 8 the
ability to target a switch statement through continue. This is no loss
in functionality (it is always possible to replace the continue with a
break), but avoids a gotcha for programmers coming from other languages.

The following code illustrates cases which are deprecated and by what
they can be replaced at various levels of loop nesting:

.. code:: php

   switch ($foo) {
       case "bar":
           continue; // Deprecated
           break;    // Use this for equivalent behavior
   }

   while ($foo) {
       switch ($bar) {
           case "baz":
               continue;   // Deprecated
               break;      // Use this for equivalent behavior
               continue 2; // Or this for C-like behavior
       }
   }

   while ($foo) {
       switch ($bar) {
           case "baz":
               while ($xyz) {
                   continue 2; // Deprecated
                   break 2;    // Use this for equivalent behavior
                   continue 3; // Or this for C-like behavior
               }
       }
   }

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

PHP 7.3 throws additional deprecation warnings, PHP 8 generates a
compile error. Fixing it is always trivial by replacing ``continue``
with ``break``.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

Continue can still be used inside switch statements, as long as it does
not target the switch. The meaning of continue and break inside switch
never changes, some cases are just forbidden.

To further clarify which uses of ``continue`` are affected, please
consider the following example:

.. code:: php

   while ($foo) {
       switch ($bar) {
           case "baz":
               while ($xyz) {
                   continue;   // Targeting the inner while loop: Allowed
                   continue 2; // Targeting the switch: Deprecated
                   continue 3; // Targeting the outer while loop: Allowed
               }
       }
   }

Vote
----

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.
